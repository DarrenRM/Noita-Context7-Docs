# Sky Light Injector Biome

This biome definition is a minimal configuration primarily used to inject light into the sky. It doesn't define any specific materials or complex topology.

## Topology

The `Topology` element is the core of this biome.

### Key Attributes

*   **`name`**: `"_EMPTY_"` - Indicates this is a placeholder or empty biome.
*   **`coarse_map_inject_light`**: `"1"` - This is the crucial attribute. Setting it to `"1"` (true) ensures that light is injected into the coarse map, effectively illuminating the sky.

## Materials

This section is empty, meaning no specific materials are defined for this biome.

## Usage

This biome is likely used in conjunction with other biome definitions or as a standalone element to control ambient light levels in the sky portion of the game world. Its primary function is to enable light injection without adding any other environmental features.
