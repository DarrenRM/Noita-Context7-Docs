# Orbroom Particle Emitter 07_01

This documentation describes the configuration for a specific particle emitter used in the "orbrooms" set within Noita. It defines the visual appearance and behavior of particles generated by this emitter.

## Entity Configuration

The core of this configuration is an `Entity` that inherits its base properties from `orbroom_base.xml`.

```xml
<Entity ><Base file="data/particles/image_emitters/orbrooms/orbroom_base.xml">
  <ParticleEmitterComponent image_animation_file="data/particles/image_emitters/orbrooms/07_01.png" />
</Base></Entity>
```

## Key Components and Attributes

### ParticleEmitterComponent

This component is responsible for generating and managing particles.

*   **`image_animation_file`**: Specifies the image file used for the particle animation. This file likely contains a sequence of frames that will be displayed over time to create the animation.
    *   **Value**: `data/particles/image_emitters/orbrooms/07_01.png`

### Base File Inheritance

The `orbroom_base.xml` file provides foundational settings for this particle emitter. While not detailed here, it's important to note that any attributes or elements defined in the base file will also apply to this specific emitter unless explicitly overridden. This promotes code reuse and consistency for similar particle effects.
