# Orbroom Particle Emitter 07_03

This document describes the configuration for a specific particle emitter used in Noita's orbroom environments. It defines the visual appearance and behavior of particles generated by this emitter.

## Entity Configuration

The core of this configuration is an `Entity` that inherits its base properties from `orbroom_base.xml`.

```xml
<Entity ><Base file="data/particles/image_emitters/orbrooms/orbroom_base.xml">
  <ParticleEmitterComponent image_animation_file="data/particles/image_emitters/orbrooms/07_03.png" />
</Base></Entity>
```

## Key Components and Attributes

### ParticleEmitterComponent

This component is responsible for generating and managing particles.

*   **`image_animation_file`**: This is the **most crucial attribute** for this specific emitter. It points to the image file (`.png`) that contains the animation frames for the particles. In this case, it's `data/particles/image_emitters/orbrooms/07_03.png`. This file dictates the visual style and animation of the emitted particles.

### Inherited Base Properties (from `orbroom_base.xml`)

While not explicitly defined in this file, the `ParticleEmitterComponent` will inherit numerous properties from its base file (`orbroom_base.xml`). These typically include:

*   **Particle Lifetime**: How long each individual particle exists.
*   **Spawn Rate**: How many particles are generated per second.
*   **Particle Size**: The initial and potentially changing size of particles.
*   **Particle Velocity**: The initial speed and direction of particles.
*   **Particle Color**: The color of the particles, which might change over their lifetime.
*   **Gravity**: Whether particles are affected by gravity.
*   **Friction**: How particle movement is slowed down.
*   **Image Animation Settings**: If the base file also defines animation properties like frame rate, looping, etc.
*   **Collision Behavior**: How particles interact with the game world.

**Note:** For a complete understanding of the particle's behavior, it is essential to consult the `orbroom_base.xml` file.
