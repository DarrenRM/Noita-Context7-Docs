# Fireblast Projectile

This document details the configuration of the `fireblast.xml` entity, which defines a player-owned projectile in Noita. It's a basic projectile that explodes on death or when its lifetime expires, creating a fire cell and a small explosion.

## Key Attributes

### Entity

*   **name**: `$projectile_default` - A generic name for projectiles.
*   **tags**: `projectile_player` - Identifies this as a projectile fired by the player.

### Base Projectile

*   **file**: `data/entities/base_projectile.xml` - Inherits core projectile functionality from the base entity.

### ProjectileComponent

This component governs the projectile's behavior.

*   **_enabled**: `1` - Ensures the component is active.
*   **lob_min/lob_max**: `0.8`/`1.0` - Controls the projectile's lobbing behavior (how much it arcs).
*   **speed_min/speed_max**: `0`/`0` - The projectile has no initial speed.
*   **die_on_low_velocity**: `1` - The projectile will die if its velocity drops too low.
*   **on_death_explode**: `1` - Triggers an explosion when the projectile dies.
*   **on_lifetime_out_explode**: `1` - Triggers an explosion when the projectile's lifetime ends.
*   **damage**: `0` - The projectile itself deals no direct damage.
*   **on_collision_die**: `1` - The projectile dies upon colliding with something.
*   **shoot_light_flash_radius**: `15` - Radius of the light flash when the projectile is shot.
*   **shoot_light_flash_r/g/b**: `255`/`210`/`80` - Color of the light flash (orange/yellow).
*   **lifetime**: `0` - The projectile has no inherent lifetime; it dies based on other conditions.

#### config_explosion

This nested configuration defines the explosion properties.

*   **never_cache**: `1` - Prevents the explosion from being cached, ensuring it's always generated fresh.
*   **camera_shake**: `4.5` - The intensity of camera shake caused by the explosion.
*   **explosion_radius**: `30` - The radius of the explosion's effect.
*   **explosion_sprite**: `data/particles/explosion_008.xml` - The visual sprite used for the explosion.
*   **ray_energy**: `200000` - The energy of the explosion's rays.
*   **create_cell_probability**: `100` - Guarantees that a new cell is created by the explosion.
*   **create_cell_material**: `fire` - The material of the cell created by the explosion is fire.
*   **damage**: `0.3` - The damage dealt by the explosion.
*   **hole_enabled**: `1` - Enables the creation of holes in terrain by the explosion.
*   **hole_image**: `data/temp/explosion_hole.png` - The image used for the explosion hole.
*   **particle_effect**: `1` - Enables particle effects for the explosion.
*   **damage_mortals**: `1` - The explosion damages living entities.
*   **physics_explosion_power.max**: `0.3` - The maximum force applied to physics objects by the explosion.
*   **sparks_enabled**: `1` - Enables sparks to be generated by the explosion.
*   **sparks_count_min/max**: `60`/`80` - The range for the number of sparks generated.
*   **spark_material**: `spark` - The material of the sparks.
*   **light_fade_time**: `0.8` - How long the light from the explosion fades.
*   **stains_enabled**: `1` - Enables stains to be left by the explosion.
*   **stains_image**: `data/temp/explosion_stain.png` - The image used for explosion stains.
*   **audio_event_name**: `explosions/fire` - The sound event triggered by the explosion.

### VariableStorageComponent

*   **name**: `projectile_file`
*   **value_string**: `data/entities/projectiles/deck/fireblast.xml` - Stores the path to this entity's file, likely for referencing.
