# Death Cross Big Projectile

This document details the `death_cross_big.xml` entity, representing a powerful player projectile in Noita. It features homing capabilities, a significant explosion upon death, and visual/audio effects.

## Key Components and Attributes

### Entity Definition

*   **`name`**: `$projectile_default` (Inherited, base projectile type)
*   **`tags`**: `projectile_player`, `death_cross` (Identifies it as a player projectile and part of the "death cross" family)

### Base Projectile (`BaseComponent`)

*   **`VelocityComponent`**:
    *   `gravity_y`: `0` (No vertical gravity applied to the projectile itself)
    *   `air_friction`: `0` (No air resistance)
    *   `mass`: `0.08` (Lightweight projectile)

### Homing Behavior (`HomingComponent`)

*   **`target_tag`**: `prey` (The projectile will attempt to home in on entities tagged as "prey")
*   **`homing_targeting_coeff`**: `3` (Strength of the homing behavior)
*   **`detect_distance`**: `350` (Range within which the projectile can detect targets)
*   **`homing_velocity_multiplier`**: `1.0` (Multiplier for the projectile's velocity when homing)

### Projectile Mechanics (`ProjectileComponent`)

*   **`lob_min` / `lob_max`**: `0.8` / `1.0` (Controls the lobbing behavior, likely minimal lobbing)
*   **`speed_min` / `speed_max`**: `0` / `0` (Initial speed is zero, likely meaning it's propelled by other forces or homing)
*   **`die_on_low_velocity`**: `0` (Does not die if its velocity drops too low)
*   **`on_death_explode`**: `1` (The projectile explodes when it dies)
*   **`on_lifetime_out_explode`**: `1` (The projectile explodes when its lifetime expires)
*   **`bounces_left`**: `20` (Can bounce a significant number of times)
*   **`lifetime`**: `50` (The projectile exists for 50 frames before expiring)
*   **`knockback_force`**: `1.6` (Applies knockback to entities it collides with)
*   **`damage_every_x_frames`**: `5` (Applies damage every 5 frames while active, though base damage is 0)

#### Explosion Configuration (`config_explosion`)

*   **`never_cache`**: `1` (Ensures the explosion is always generated fresh)
*   **`camera_shake`**: `30.5` (Significant camera shake upon explosion)
*   **`explosion_radius`**: `35` (The radius of the explosion effect)
*   **`explosion_sprite`**: `data/particles/explosion_032_slime.xml` (Visual effect for the explosion)
*   **`create_cell_probability`**: `10` (Chance to create a cell upon explosion)
*   **`create_cell_material`**: `spark_green` (Material of the created cells)
*   **`load_this_entity`**: `data/entities/projectiles/deck/death_cross_big_explosion.xml` (Loads a specific entity for the explosion effect)
*   **`ray_energy`**: `2039000` (High energy for potential ray interactions)
*   **`max_durability_to_destroy`**: `11` (How much durability it can destroy on impact)
*   **`hole_destroy_liquid`**: `1` (Can destroy liquids)
*   **`hole_enabled`**: `1` (Creates holes upon impact)
*   **`damage`**: `4` (Damage dealt by the explosion itself)
*   **`physics_explosion_power.min` / `.max`**: `1.2` / `2.2` (Force of the physics-based explosion)
*   **`sparks_enabled`**: `1` (Sparks are generated by the explosion)
*   **`spark_material`**: `spark_green` (Material of the sparks)
*   **`light_r` / `g` / `b`**: `125` / `250` / `40` (Color of the light emitted by the explosion)
*   **`stains_enabled`**: `1` (Creates stains on surfaces)

### Visuals (`SpriteComponent`)

*   **`_enabled`**: `0` (This sprite component is disabled by default)
*   **`image_file`**: `data/projectiles_gfx/glow.xml` (Uses a glow effect graphic)
*   **`additive`**: `1` (Additive blending for the glow effect)

### Lighting (`LightComponent`)

*   **`_enabled`**: `1` (The light component is active)
*   **`radius`**: `250` (The radius of the light emitted by the projectile)
*   **`r` / `g` / `b`**: `180` / `255` / `40` (Color of the emitted light)

### Particle Emitters (`ParticleEmitterComponent`)

Two emitters are present, both emitting `spark_green` particles. They differ in their velocity distribution:
*   One emitter primarily affects horizontal velocity (`x_vel_min`/`max`).
*   The other emitter primarily affects vertical velocity (`y_vel_min`/`max`).
*   Both have a `lifetime_min`/`max` of `0.3` to `2.6` seconds and emit cosmetic particles.

### Audio (`AudioComponent`)

*   **`file`**: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank` (Sound bank used)
*   **`event_root`**: `player_projectiles/death_cross_big` (Specific audio event for this projectile)

### Variable Storage (`VariableStorageComponent`)

*   **`name`**: `projectile_file`
*   **`value_string`**: `data/entities/projectiles/deck/death_cross_big.xml` (Stores the path to this entity's file)
