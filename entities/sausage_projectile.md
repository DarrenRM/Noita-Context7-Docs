# Sausage Projectile

This document details the configuration of the "Sausage" projectile entity in Noita, focusing on its physical properties, damage, and explosion behavior.

## Core Components

### PhysicsBodyComponent
Manages the physical presence and behavior of the projectile in the game world.

*   **`uid`**: `1` - Unique identifier for this component.
*   **`is_bullet`**: `1` - Indicates this entity is treated as a projectile.
*   **`allow_sleep`**: `1` - Allows the physics body to enter a sleep state when inactive.
*   **`linear_damping`**: `0` - No linear damping applied.
*   **`angular_damping`**: `0` - No angular damping applied.
*   **`fixed_rotation`**: `0` - Rotation is not fixed, allowing it to tumble.

### PhysicsImageShapeComponent
Defines the visual representation and collision shape of the projectile.

*   **`body_id`**: `1` - Links this shape to the `PhysicsBodyComponent` with `uid="1"`.
*   **`image_file`**: `"data/projectiles_gfx/sosig.png"` - Specifies the sprite used for the projectile.
*   **`material`**: `"meat"` - The material type, influencing interactions with other game elements.
*   **`centered`**: `1` - The image is centered on the entity's origin.

### ProjectileComponent
Governs the projectile's lifecycle and basic projectile mechanics.

*   **`lifetime`**: `-1` - The projectile does not despawn based on time.
*   **`penetrate_entities`**: `1` - The projectile can pass through multiple entities.
*   **`damage`**: `0.0` - Base damage dealt by the projectile itself.
*   **`do_moveto_update`**: `0` - Does not use the `moveto` update system.

### VelocityComponent
Determines the initial velocity and movement of the projectile.

*   (No specific attributes are set here, implying it's typically controlled by external forces or initial spawning parameters.)

### DamageModelComponent
Handles damage-related properties and interactions.

*   **`hp`**: `11.1` - The hit points of the projectile.
*   **`critical_damage_resistance`**: `1` - No resistance to critical damage.
*   **`falling_damages`**: `0` - Does not take damage from falling.
*   **`fire_damage_amount`**: `0` - Does not deal fire damage.
*   **`fire_probability_of_ignition`**: `0` - Cannot ignite targets.
*   **`air_needed`**: `0` - Does not require air to function.
*   **`drop_items_on_death`**: `0` - Does not drop items upon death.
*   **`materials_create_messages`**: `0` - Does not create messages when interacting with materials.
*   **`materials_damage`**: `0` - Does not damage materials directly.

#### `damage_multipliers`
Specific multipliers for different damage types.

*   **`melee`**: `0.1` - Melee damage is reduced to 10% of its base value.

### ExplodeOnDamageComponent
Defines behavior when the projectile takes damage or is destroyed.

*   **`explode_on_death_percent`**: `1` - Always explodes upon death.
*   **`explode_on_damage_percent`**: `0.0` - Does not explode when taking damage (only on death).
*   **`physics_body_modified_death_probability`**: `0.9` - 90% chance to explode if its physics body is modified upon death.
*   **`physics_body_destruction_required`**: `0.5` - Requires 50% of its physics body to be destroyed before triggering death explosion.

#### `config_explosion`
Configuration for the explosion effect.

*   **`damage`**: `0` - The explosion itself deals no direct damage.
*   **`camera_shake`**: `10` - Applies a moderate camera shake.
*   **`explosion_radius`**: `15` - The radius of the explosion effect.
*   **`create_cell_probability`**: `70` - 70% chance to create cells.
*   **`create_cell_material`**: `"blood"` - The material of the created cells is blood.
*   **`ray_energy`**: `80000` - The energy of any rays generated by the explosion.
*   **`spark_count_min`**: `20` - Minimum number of sparks created.
*   **`spark_count_max`**: `40` - Maximum number of sparks created.
*   **`spark_material`**: `"blood"` - Sparks are made of blood material.
*   **`sparks_enabled`**: `1` - Sparks are enabled.
*   **`audio_enabled`**: `0` - Explosion sound is disabled.
*   **`hole_enabled`**: `0` - Does not create holes in terrain.
*   **`particle_effect`**: `0` - No specific particle effect is defined.

### AudioComponent
Manages the sound effects associated with the projectile.

*   **`file`**: `"data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank"` - The audio bank containing the sound events.
*   **`event_root`**: `"player_projectiles/throwable"` - The root event path for throwable player projectiles.
