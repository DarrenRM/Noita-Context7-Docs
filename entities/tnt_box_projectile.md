# TNT Box Projectile

This document details the configuration for the TNT Box projectile entity in Noita, focusing on its physical properties, projectile behavior, and explosive capabilities.

## Core Entity Configuration

The `Entity` tag defines the fundamental properties of the TNT Box.

```xml
<Entity tags="hittable,teleportable_NOT,mortal,item_physics,projectile" >
  <!-- ... other components ... -->
</Entity>
```

*   **`tags`**:
    *   `hittable`: The entity can be hit by other projectiles or attacks.
    *   `teleportable_NOT`: This entity cannot be teleported.
    *   `mortal`: The entity can be destroyed.
    *   `item_physics`: Indicates it has physics properties related to items.
    *   `projectile`: The entity functions as a projectile.

## Base Projectile Physics

The `Base` component inherits common projectile physics properties.

```xml
<Base file="data/entities/base_projectile_physics.xml">
  <!-- ... physics components ... -->
</Base>
```

### `PhysicsBodyComponent`

Manages the physical presence and movement of the projectile.

*   `hax_fix_going_through_ground="0"`: Disables a specific fix for ground collision.
*   `projectiles_rotate_toward_velocity="1"`: The projectile will orient itself to face its direction of movement.

### `PhysicsImageShapeComponent`

Defines the visual representation and collision shape.

*   `image_file="data/props_gfx/tnt_box.png"`: Specifies the sprite used for the TNT box.
*   `material="wood_prop_noplayerhit"`: The material type, which influences interactions.

### `PhysicsThrowableComponent`

Enables the projectile to be thrown.

*   `attach_to_surfaces_knife_style="0"`: Disables a specific attachment behavior.
*   `throw_force_coeff="0.75"`: A coefficient affecting the force applied when thrown.

## Projectile Behavior

The `ProjectileComponent` governs how the entity behaves as a projectile.

```xml
<ProjectileComponent
  _tags="enabled_in_world"
  lifetime="-1"
  on_collision_die="0"
  damage="0"
  muzzle_flash_file="data/entities/particles/muzzle_flashes/muzzle_flash_launcher_large.xml"
  shoot_light_flash_radius="120"
  shoot_light_flash_r="255"
  shoot_light_flash_g="240"
  shoot_light_flash_b="30"
  damage_every_x_frames="25"
  do_moveto_update="1"
>
  <!-- ... explosion configuration ... -->
</ProjectileComponent>
```

*   `lifetime="-1"`: The projectile does not have a time limit before expiring.
*   `on_collision_die="0"`: The projectile does not die upon collision.
*   `damage="0"`: The projectile itself deals no direct damage.
*   `muzzle_flash_file`: Path to the particle effect for the muzzle flash.
*   `shoot_light_flash_radius`, `shoot_light_flash_r`, `shoot_light_flash_g`, `shoot_light_flash_b`: Defines the radius and color of a light flash when shot.
*   `damage_every_x_frames="25"`: Damage is applied every 25 frames (relevant if `damage` was > 0).
*   `do_moveto_update="1"`: Enables movement updates for the projectile.

### `config_explosion` (within `ProjectileComponent`)

Defines the explosion parameters when the projectile's `on_collision_die` or `ExplosionComponent` triggers an explosion.

*   `damage="5"`: The damage dealt by the explosion.
*   `camera_shake="10"`: The intensity of camera shake during the explosion.
*   `explosion_radius="40"`: The radius of the explosion's effect.
*   `explosion_sprite`: Path to the particle effect for the explosion visual.
*   `load_this_entity`: Path to another entity to load upon explosion (e.g., for secondary effects).
*   `create_cell_probability="80"`: Probability (in percent) of creating environmental cells.
*   `hole_destroy_liquid="1"`: The explosion can destroy liquids.
*   `ray_energy="350000"`: Energy value for raycasting effects of the explosion.
*   `hole_enabled="1"`: The explosion creates holes in terrain.
*   `particle_effect="1"`: Enables particle effects for the explosion.
*   `damage_mortals="1"`: The explosion damages mortal entities.
*   `physics_throw_enabled="1"`: The explosion can throw physics objects.
*   `sparks_enabled="1"`: Sparks are generated by the explosion.

## Damage Model

The `DamageModelComponent` defines how the entity takes damage.

```xml
<DamageModelComponent
  _tags="enabled_in_world"
  hp="10.9"
  critical_damage_resistance="1"
>
  <damage_multipliers
    melee="0.1"
  ></damage_multipliers>
</DamageModelComponent>
```

*   `hp="10.9"`: The hit points of the TNT box.
*   `critical_damage_resistance="1"`: No resistance to critical damage.
*   `damage_multipliers`: Modifiers for incoming damage types.
    *   `melee="0.1"`: Takes only 10% of damage from melee attacks.

## Explosion Components

The TNT Box can explode through multiple mechanisms.

### `ExplosionComponent`

Triggers an explosion based on a specific event.

*   `trigger="ON_DEATH"`: The explosion occurs when the entity dies.
*   Contains a `config_explosion` block identical to the one in `ProjectileComponent`.

### `ExplodeOnDamageComponent`

Allows the entity to explode when damaged.

*   `explode_on_death_percent="1"`: Explodes when health reaches 0%.
*   `explode_on_damage_percent="0.1"`: Explodes when health drops to 10% or less.
*   `physics_body_modified_death_probability="0.9"`: High probability of exploding if the physics body is modified upon death.
*   `physics_body_destruction_required="0.2"`: Requires 20% of the physics body to be destroyed for this trigger.
*   Contains a `config_explosion` block identical to the one in `ProjectileComponent`.

## UI and Audio

*   **`UIInfoComponent`**:
    *   `name="$item_tntbox"`: The internal name for UI display (likely localized).
*   **`AudioComponent`**:
    *   `file="data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank"`: Specifies the audio bank.
    *   `event_root="player_projectiles/throwable"`: The root event for throwable projectile sounds.

## Variable Storage

*   **`VariableStorageComponent`**:
    *   `name="projectile_file"`: Stores the path to this entity's XML file.
    *   `value_string="data/entities/projectiles/deck/tntbox.xml"`: The actual path.
