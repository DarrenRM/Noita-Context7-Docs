# Cluster Bomb Projectile

This document details the configuration for the Cluster Bomb projectile entity in Noita, designed for AI-assisted modding.

## Core Entity Configuration

The Cluster Bomb is a projectile with explosive properties, designed to deal damage and create a significant impact upon death or collision.

### Base Projectile Properties

*   **`mass`**: `0.07` - Defines the projectile's mass, influencing its trajectory and interaction with physics.

### Projectile Component

This component governs the projectile's behavior, including its movement, damage, and explosive effects.

*   **`_enabled`**: `1` - Enables the projectile component.
*   **`lob_min` / `lob_max`**: `0.9` / `1.0` - Controls the minimum and maximum lob angle, affecting the projectile's arc.
*   **`speed_min` / `speed_max`**: `250` / `280` - Sets the projectile's initial speed range.
*   **`friction`**: `0.6` - Determines how quickly the projectile loses speed due to air resistance.
*   **`direction_random_rad`**: `0.05` - Introduces a slight random deviation in the projectile's initial direction.
*   **`on_death_explode`**: `1` - Triggers an explosion when the projectile's lifetime ends.
*   **`on_lifetime_out_explode`**: `1` - Also triggers an explosion when the projectile's lifetime expires.
*   **`on_collision_die`**: `0` - The projectile does not die upon collision, allowing for bounces.
*   **`lifetime`**: `100` - The duration in frames before the projectile explodes if it hasn't collided.
*   **`damage`**: `0` - Base damage of the projectile itself before explosion.
*   **`bounces_left`**: `4` - The number of times the projectile can bounce before expiring.
*   **`camera_shake_when_shot`**: `5.0` - The intensity of camera shake when this projectile is fired.
*   **`muzzle_flash_file`**: `data/entities/particles/muzzle_flashes/muzzle_flash_launcher.xml` - Specifies the particle effect for the muzzle flash.

#### `config_explosion` Sub-component

This nested configuration defines the properties of the explosion triggered by the projectile.

*   **`never_cache`**: `1` - Prevents the explosion from being cached, ensuring it's always generated fresh.
*   **`camera_shake`**: `20` - The intensity of camera shake caused by the explosion.
*   **`explosion_radius`**: `20` - The radius of the explosion's effect.
*   **`explosion_sprite`**: `data/particles/explosion_032.xml` - The visual sprite used for the explosion.
*   **`load_this_entity`**: `data/entities/particles/particle_explosion/main_gunpowder_small.xml` - The entity to load for the explosion's particle effects.
*   **`hole_enabled`**: `1` - Enables the creation of holes in the environment from the explosion.
*   **`hole_destroy_liquid`**: `1` - The explosion will destroy liquids within its radius.
*   **`ray_energy`**: `900000` - The energy of the explosion's damaging rays.
*   **`damage`**: `4` - The damage dealt by the explosion.
*   **`physics_explosion_power.min` / `physics_explosion_power.max`**: `2.9` / `4.3` - The minimum and maximum force applied to physics objects by the explosion.
*   **`physics_throw_enabled`**: `1` - Enables physics objects to be thrown by the explosion.
*   **`sparks_enabled`**: `1` - Enables sparks to be generated by the explosion.
*   **`stains_enabled`**: `1` - Enables explosion stains to be left on surfaces.
*   **`stains_radius`**: `12` - The radius of the explosion stains.
*   **`audio_event_name`**: `explosions/tnt` - The audio event triggered by the explosion.

### Sprite Components

These components define the visual appearance of the projectile.

*   **`image_file`**: `data/projectiles_gfx/pipe_bomb.xml` - The primary sprite for the projectile.
*   **`image_file`**: `data/projectiles_gfx/pipe_bomb_emissive.xml` - An emissive sprite for added visual effect.
*   **`emissive`**: `1` - Marks the second sprite as emissive.
*   **`additive`**: `1` - Indicates additive blending for the emissive sprite.

### Audio Component

*   **`file`**: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank` - The audio bank containing projectile sounds.
*   **`event_root`**: `projectiles/bullet_fire_heavy` - The specific audio event for firing this projectile.

### Variable Storage Component

*   **`name`**: `projectile_file`
*   **`value_string`**: `data/entities/projectiles/clusterbomb.xml` - Stores the path to this entity's XML file, useful for referencing.
