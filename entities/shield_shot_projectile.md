# Shield Shot Projectile

This document details the configuration for the `shieldshot.xml` projectile entity in Noita, designed for AI-assisted modding.

## Core Components

The `shieldshot` projectile utilizes several key components to define its behavior, appearance, and effects.

### Base Projectile (`Base file="data/entities/base_projectile.xml"`)

This component inherits fundamental projectile properties.

*   **`gravity_y="0"`**: The projectile is unaffected by gravity.
*   **`air_friction="-2.0"`**: A negative air friction value suggests it might accelerate or maintain velocity in air.
*   **`mass="0.04"`**: Defines the projectile's mass.

### Homing (`HomingComponent`)

This projectile has homing capabilities.

*   **`target_tag="homing_target"`**: Specifies the tag for entities that can be targeted.
*   **`homing_targeting_coeff="30.0"`**: Controls the strength of the homing adjustment.
*   **`homing_velocity_multiplier="1.99"`**: Multiplies the projectile's velocity when homing.
*   **`detect_distance="300"`**: The maximum distance at which the projectile can detect targets.

### Projectile (`ProjectileComponent`)

This is the primary component defining the projectile's behavior.

*   **`lob_min="0.8"`, `lob_max="1.1"`**: Defines the minimum and maximum lobbing angles, influencing its trajectory.
*   **`speed_min="200"`, `speed_max="250"`**: Sets the range for the projectile's initial speed.
*   **`friendly_fire="1"`**: Allows the projectile to damage friendly entities.
*   **`on_death_explode="1"`**: The projectile explodes upon death.
*   **`on_death_gfx_leave_sprite="0"`**: Does not leave a sprite when it dies.
*   **`on_lifetime_out_explode="1"`**: Explodes when its lifetime expires.
*   **`explosion_dont_damage_shooter="1"`**: The explosion does not damage the entity that fired it.
*   **`on_collision_die="1"`**: The projectile dies upon collision.
*   **`lifetime="50"`**: The projectile's lifespan in frames.
*   **`velocity_sets_scale="1"`**: Velocity influences scaling.
*   **`collide_with_shooter_frames="4"`**: The projectile can collide with its shooter for a short duration.
*   **`damage="0"`**: The projectile itself deals no direct damage.
*   **`muzzle_flash_file="data/entities/particles/muzzle_flashes/muzzle_flash_large.xml"`**: Specifies the muzzle flash particle effect.

#### Explosion Configuration (`config_explosion`)

Defines the properties of the projectile's explosion.

*   **`damage="0"`**: The explosion deals no damage.
*   **`explosion_radius="1"`**: The radius of the explosion.
*   **`explosion_sprite="data/particles/explosion_016_plasma.xml"`**: The visual sprite for the explosion.
*   **`ray_energy="10000"`**: The energy of any rays generated by the explosion.
*   **`physics_throw_enabled="1"`**: The explosion can throw physics objects.
*   **`shake_vegetation="1"`**: The explosion shakes vegetation.

### Sprite (`SpriteComponent`)

Defines the visual appearance of the projectile.

*   **`image_file="data/projectiles_gfx/grenade_blue.xml"`**: The sprite image file.
*   **`emissive="1"`, `additive="1"`**: Indicates emissive and additive rendering for a glowing effect.

### Particle Emitter (`ParticleEmitterComponent`)

Generates cosmetic particles, likely for a trail effect.

*   **`emitted_material_name="spark_blue"`**: The material of the emitted particles.
*   **`is_trail="1"`**: Indicates this is a trail emitter.
*   **`emit_cosmetic_particles="1"`**: Emits cosmetic particles.

### Audio (`AudioComponent`)

Handles the sound effects for the projectile.

*   **`file="data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank"`**: The audio bank file.
*   **`event_root="projectiles/bullet_shield"`**: The root event for projectile sounds.

### Hit Effect (`HitEffectComponent`)

Defines what happens when the projectile hits something.

*   **`effect_hit="LOAD_UNIQUE_CHILD_ENTITY"`**: Loads a unique child entity upon hit.
*   **`value_string="data/entities/misc/shieldshot_shield.xml"`**: The path to the entity to load, likely a shield effect.

### Variable Storage (`VariableStorageComponent`)

Stores variables associated with the entity.

*   **`name="projectile_file"`**: The name of the variable.
*   **`value_string="data/entities/projectiles/shieldshot.xml"`**: The value, pointing back to this projectile's file.
