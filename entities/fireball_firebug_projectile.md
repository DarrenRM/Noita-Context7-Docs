# Fireball (Firebug) Projectile

This document details the configuration for a fireball projectile, likely originating from a "Firebug" entity in Noita. It focuses on its physical properties, visual representation, and explosive behavior.

## Core Projectile Properties

The `ProjectileComponent` defines the fundamental behavior of the fireball.

### Key Attributes:

| Attribute                 | Value      | Description                                                                 |
| :------------------------ | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lob_min`, `lob_max`      | `0.9`, `1.0` | Controls the arc of the projectile. Values close to 1 indicate a straight trajectory. |
| `speed_min`, `speed_max`  | `100`, `120` | The initial speed range of the projectile.                                  |
| `friction`                | `0.6`      | How quickly the projectile loses speed over time.                           |
| `direction_random_rad`    | `0.05`     | Introduces a small amount of randomness to the projectile's initial direction. |
| `on_death_explode`        | `1`        | The projectile will explode upon death (e.g., hitting a surface).           |
| `on_lifetime_out_explode` | `1`        | The projectile will explode when its lifetime expires.                      |
| `on_collision_die`        | `1`        | The projectile will be destroyed upon collision with anything.              |
| `die_on_liquid_collision` | `1`        | The projectile will be destroyed upon collision with any liquid.            |
| `lifetime`                | `70`       | The base duration (in frames) the projectile exists before expiring.        |
| `lifetime_randomness`     | `7`        | Adds randomness to the projectile's lifetime.                               |
| `knockback_force`         | `0.6`      | The force applied to entities when the projectile hits them.                |

### Damage Types:

| Type  | Value | Description                                                              |
| :---- | :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fire`| `0.2` | The projectile deals a small amount of fire damage upon impact.          |

## Explosion Configuration

The `config_explosion` element details the effects when the fireball explodes.

### Key Attributes:

| Attribute                 | Value      | Description                                                                 |
| :------------------------ | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `camera_shake`            | `4`        | The intensity of camera shake experienced by players during the explosion.  |
| `explosion_radius`        | `7`        | The radius of the explosion's effect.                                       |
| `explosion_sprite`        | `data/particles/explosion_016.xml` | The visual effect used for the explosion.                               |
| `create_cell_probability` | `50`       | The chance (in percent) that the explosion will create terrain cells.       |
| `hole_enabled`            | `1`        | Enables the creation of holes in terrain by the explosion.                  |
| `ray_energy`              | `10000`    | The energy of any damaging rays emitted by the explosion.                   |
| `damage`                  | `0`        | The base damage dealt by the explosion itself (distinct from projectile damage). |
| `damage_mortals`          | `1`        | The explosion will damage mortal entities.                                  |
| `physics_explosion_power` | `0.05` to `0.1` | The force applied to physics objects by the explosion.                      |
| `shake_vegetation`        | `1`        | The explosion will shake nearby vegetation.                                 |
| `sparks_enabled`          | `1`        | Sparks will be generated by the explosion.                                  |
| `stains_enabled`          | `1`        | The explosion will leave stains on surfaces.                                |

## Visuals and Effects

### Sprite Component:

*   `image_file`: `data/projectiles_gfx/grenade_scavenger_small.xml` - Specifies the graphical asset for the projectile.
*   `additive`: `1` - The sprite uses additive blending, making it appear brighter.
*   `emissive`: `1` - The sprite emits light.

### Particle Emitter Component:

*   `emitted_material_name`: `fire` - The particles emitted are of the "fire" material type.
*   `count_min`, `count_max`: `1`, `1` - Emits a single particle per emission.
*   `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max`: `0.1`, `0.3` - Short lifespan for emitted particles.
*   `emission_interval_min_frames`, `emission_interval_max_frames`: `1`, `2` - Particles are emitted frequently.

### Light Component:

*   `radius`: `40` - The fireball emits light with a radius of 40 units.

## Audio Component

*   `file`: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank`
*   `event_root`: `projectiles/bullet_fire_small` - This indicates the sound event triggered by the projectile.

## Internal Variable Storage

*   `projectile_file`: `data/entities/projectiles/fireball_firebug.xml` - Stores the path to this entity's definition, likely for internal referencing.
