# Machinegun Bullet (Tank)

This document details the configuration for a machinegun bullet projectile, specifically designed for tank-like applications. It focuses on its physical properties, projectile behavior, visual representation, and associated audio.

## Base Projectile Configuration

The projectile inherits fundamental properties from a base projectile entity.

### Base Entity Inheritance

*   **`Base file="data/entities/base_projectile.xml"`**: Indicates that this entity extends the functionality of the generic `base_projectile.xml`.

### Velocity Component

Defines the physical mass of the projectile.

*   **`mass="0.05"`**: The mass of the bullet.

## Projectile Component

This is the core component defining the projectile's behavior and characteristics.

### Key Attributes

*   **`_enabled="1"`**: Enables this component.
*   **`lob_min="0.8"`, `lob_max="0.9"`**: Defines the minimum and maximum lob (arc) of the projectile, influencing its trajectory.
*   **`speed_min="400"`, `speed_max="500"`**: Sets the minimum and maximum initial speed of the projectile.
*   **`friction="1.3"`**: The amount of friction applied to the projectile, affecting its deceleration.
*   **`direction_random_rad="0.1"`**: Introduces a small amount of randomness to the projectile's initial direction.
*   **`on_death_explode="1"`**: Causes the projectile to explode upon death (e.g., collision or lifetime out).
*   **`on_lifetime_out_explode="1"`**: Ensures the projectile explodes when its lifetime expires.
*   **`explosion_dont_damage_shooter="1"`**: Prevents the projectile's explosion from damaging the entity that fired it.
*   **`on_collision_die="1"`**: The projectile dies upon collision with an entity.
*   **`lifetime="50"`**: The duration in frames before the projectile expires.
*   **`knockback_force="0.4"`**: The force applied to entities when the projectile hits them.
*   **`damage="0.15"`**: The base damage dealt by the projectile.
*   **`go_through_this_material="aluminium_robot"`**: Specifies a material that the projectile can pass through without colliding.
*   **`muzzle_flash_file="data/entities/particles/muzzle_flashes/muzzle_flash_medium.xml"`**: The particle effect to be used as a muzzle flash when this projectile is fired.
*   **`camera_shake_when_shot="2.0"`**: The intensity of camera shake experienced by the shooter when this projectile is fired.
*   **`shoot_light_flash_radius="64"`**: The radius of the light flash emitted when the projectile is shot.
*   **`create_shell_casing="1"`**: Enables the creation of shell casings when the projectile is fired.
*   **`shell_casing_offset.x="-10"`, `shell_casing_offset.y="-4"`**: The offset from the firing point where shell casings are created.
*   **`bounces_left="0"`**: The number of bounces the projectile can perform before dying.

### Explosion Configuration (`config_explosion`)

Defines the properties of the explosion that occurs when the projectile dies.

*   **`damage="0.4"`**: The damage dealt by the explosion.
*   **`camera_shake="0.5"`**: The intensity of camera shake caused by the explosion.
*   **`explosion_radius="2"`**: The radius of the explosion's effect.
*   **`explosion_sprite="data/particles/explosion_008.xml"`**: The sprite used for the explosion visual.
*   **`hole_enabled="1"`**: Enables the creation of holes in surfaces from the explosion.
*   **`hole_image="data/temp/explosion_hole.png"`**: The image used for the explosion hole.
*   **`ray_energy="400000"`**: The energy of the destructive rays emitted by the explosion.
*   **`max_durability_to_destroy="9"`**: The maximum durability of objects that can be destroyed by the explosion.
*   **`physics_explosion_power.min="0.08"`, `physics_explosion_power.max="0.1"`**: The minimum and maximum power of the physics-based explosion force.
*   **`physics_throw_enabled="1"`**: Enables physics-based throwing of objects by the explosion.
*   **`shake_vegetation="1"`**: Causes vegetation to shake from the explosion.
*   **`sparks_count_max="20"`, `sparks_count_min="7"`**: The range for the number of sparks generated by the explosion.
*   **`material_sparks_enabled="1"`**: Enables sparks to be generated from impacted materials.
*   **`stains_enabled="1"`**: Enables the creation of stains from the explosion.
*   **`stains_radius="3"`**: The radius of the stains created by the explosion.

## Sprite Component

Defines the visual appearance of the projectile.

*   **`_enabled="1"`**: Enables this component.
*   **`image_file="data/projectiles_gfx/bullet.xml"`**: The file containing the projectile's sprite data.

## Audio Component

Handles the sound effects associated with the projectile.

*   **`file="data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank"`**: The audio bank containing the projectile sounds.
*   **`event_root="projectiles/minigun"`**: The root event name for sounds related to this projectile.

## Variable Storage Component

Stores custom variables for the entity.

*   **`name="projectile_file"`**: The name of the variable.
*   **`value_string="data/entities/projectiles/machinegun_bullet_tank.xml"`**: The string value, referencing the entity's own file path.
