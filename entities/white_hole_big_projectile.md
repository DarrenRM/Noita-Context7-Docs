# White Hole Big Projectile

This document details the configuration of the "White Hole Big" projectile entity in Noita, focusing on key attributes relevant for AI-assisted modding.

## Core Projectile Properties

The `ProjectileComponent` defines the fundamental behavior of the projectile.

### Key Attributes:

*   `lob_min`, `lob_max`: Controls the initial lobbing behavior of the projectile.
*   `speed_min`, `speed_max`: Set to `0`, indicating the projectile doesn't have inherent forward speed upon creation.
*   `on_death_explode`: `1` - The projectile explodes when its lifetime ends or it collides.
*   `on_lifetime_out_explode`: `1` - Ensures explosion upon lifetime expiration.
*   `explosion_dont_damage_shooter`: `1` - Prevents the projectile's explosion from harming the player who fired it.
*   `on_collision_die`: `0` - The projectile does not die on collision, allowing it to persist and exert its effects.
*   `lifetime`: `500` frames - The duration the projectile exists before exploding.
*   `damage`: `0` - The projectile itself deals no direct damage.
*   `damage_every_x_frames`: `5` - Damage is applied periodically if the projectile has a damage component.
*   `knockback_force`: `0.1` - A small knockback is applied.
*   `penetrate_entities`: `1` - The projectile can pass through multiple entities.
*   `lifetime_randomness`: `7` - Adds slight variation to the projectile's lifetime.
*   `camera_shake_when_shot`: `0.4` - Triggers a small camera shake when the projectile is fired.
*   `collide_with_shooter_frames`: `10` - The projectile will ignore collisions with the shooter for the first 10 frames.
*   `collide_with_entities`: `0` - The projectile does not collide with other entities in the traditional sense, but rather interacts via its black hole effect.
*   `friendly_fire`: `1` - The projectile can affect friendly entities.
*   `shoot_light_flash_radius`, `shoot_light_flash_r`, `shoot_light_flash_g`, `shoot_light_flash_b`: Defines the visual light flash when the projectile is fired.

### Explosion Configuration (`config_explosion`):

*   `damage`: `0` - The explosion itself deals no damage.
*   `explosion_radius`: `1` - A very small radius for the explosion effect.
*   `explosion_sprite`: `data/particles/black_hole_big_circle_out.xml` - The visual sprite for the explosion.
*   `hole_enabled`: `1` - Enables the black hole effect as part of the explosion.
*   `sparks_count_min`, `sparks_count_max`: Controls the number of sparks generated by the explosion.
*   `spark_material`: `spark_white` - The material used for the sparks.

## Visual Representation

The `SpriteComponent` defines the projectile's appearance.

### Key Attributes:

*   `alpha`: `0.1` - The sprite is highly transparent.
*   `image_file`: `data/projectiles_gfx/black_hole_big_circle.xml` - The texture used for the projectile.
*   `emissive`, `additive`: `1` - The sprite is rendered with emissive and additive blending for a glowing effect.

## Particle Effects

The `ParticleEmitterComponent` generates cosmetic particles around the projectile.

### Key Attributes:

*   `emitted_material_name`: `spark_white` - The material of the emitted particles.
*   `x_pos_offset_min`, `y_pos_offset_min`, `x_pos_offset_max`, `y_pos_offset_max`: Defines the area around the projectile where particles are emitted.
*   `x_vel_min`, `y_vel_min`, `x_vel_max`, `y_vel_max`: Controls the initial velocity of the emitted particles.
*   `count_min`, `count_max`: The number of particles emitted per emission.
*   `attractor_force`: `32` - Particles are pulled towards the projectile.
*   `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max`: The lifespan of the emitted particles.
*   `emit_cosmetic_particles`: `1` - Ensures these are cosmetic and don't affect gameplay directly.
*   `emission_interval_min_frames`, `emission_interval_max_frames`: Controls how frequently particles are emitted.

## Lighting

The `LightComponent` adds a dynamic light source.

### Key Attributes:

*   `r`, `g`, `b`: `255`, `40`, `255` - Defines the pinkish-purple color of the light.
*   `radius`: `128` - The radius of the light's influence.

## Black Hole Mechanics

The `BlackHoleComponent` implements the core black hole functionality.

### Key Attributes:

*   `particle_attractor_force`: `-6` - The force that pulls particles towards the black hole.
*   `damage_probability`: `0.25` - A chance for entities within the radius to take damage.
*   `radius`: `1` - The effective radius of the black hole's pull.

## Scripting

The `LuaComponent`s integrate custom Lua scripts for advanced behavior.

### Key Scripts:

*   `data/scripts/projectiles/white_hole_big.lua`: Primary script for the projectile's behavior.
*   `data/scripts/projectiles/white_hole_gravity.lua`: Likely handles gravity-related effects or interactions.
*   `execute_every_n_frame`: Controls how often the scripts are executed.

## Audio

The `AudioComponent` and `AudioLoopComponent` manage sound effects.

### Key Attributes:

*   `file`: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank` - The audio bank containing the sounds.
*   `event_root`, `event_name`: Specifies the particular sound events to play for the projectile.
*   `auto_play`: `1` - The loop sound starts automatically.

## Environmental Interaction

The nested `Entity` with `LooseGroundComponent` allows the projectile to affect the environment.

### Key Attributes:

*   `max_distance`: `80` - The maximum distance from the projectile at which ground can be affected.
*   `probability`: `0.2` - The chance that loose ground will be created.
*   `chunk_probability`: `0.03` - The chance that chunks of ground will be created.

## Variable Storage

The `VariableStorageComponent` stores the projectile's own file path.

### Key Attributes:

*   `name`: `projectile_file`
*   `value_string`: `data/entities/projectiles/deck/white_hole_big.xml`
