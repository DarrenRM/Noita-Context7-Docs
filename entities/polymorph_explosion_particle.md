# Polymorph Explosion Particle

This entity defines the visual and behavioral aspects of a polymorph explosion effect in Noita. It primarily uses particle emitters to create a dynamic and visually engaging explosion.

## Key Components

### ProjectileComponent

This component defines the projectile's behavior, particularly its lifespan and how it interacts with the environment.

| Attribute              | Description                                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lifetime`             | The duration (in frames) before the projectile triggers its `on_lifetime_out_explode` event. |
| `on_lifetime_out_explode` | Set to `1` to trigger an explosion when the projectile's lifetime ends.     |
| `damage`               | Base damage of the projectile. Set to `0` for this explosion effect.        |
| `speed_min`, `speed_max` | Minimum and maximum speed of the projectile. Set to `0` as it's not meant to travel. |

#### config_explosion

This nested configuration within `ProjectileComponent` details the explosion's properties.

| Attribute                 | Description                                                                 |
| :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `damage`                  | Damage dealt by the explosion. Set to `0` for this effect.                  |
| `explosion_radius`        | The radius of the explosion. Set to `0` as particle emitters handle the spread. |
| `particle_effect`         | Controls if particle effects are generated by the explosion. Set to `0`.    |
| `damage_mortals`          | Whether the explosion damages living entities. Set to `0`.                  |
| `physics_explosion_power` | The force applied to physics objects. Set to `0`.                           |

### SpriteParticleEmitterComponent

This component is responsible for emitting visual sprite particles that form the core of the explosion's appearance.
