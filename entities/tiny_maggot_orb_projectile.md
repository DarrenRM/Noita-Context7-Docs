# Tiny Maggot Orb Projectile

This document describes the `orb.xml` entity, which represents a projectile fired by the tiny maggot. It's designed to be a fast-moving, homing projectile that explodes on impact or after a set lifetime.

## Key Components and Attributes

This projectile utilizes several core components to define its behavior and appearance.

### Base Projectile (`BaseComponent`)

*   **`gravity_y="0"`**: The projectile is not affected by gravity.
*   **`air_friction="0"`**: No air resistance slows the projectile.
*   **`mass="0.8"`**: A relatively low mass for the projectile.

### Homing Behavior (`HomingComponent`)

*   **`target_tag="mortal"`**: The projectile actively seeks out entities tagged as "mortal" (typically enemies and the player).
*   **`homing_targeting_coeff="7"`**: A strong coefficient for homing, making it aggressively pursue targets.
*   **`detect_distance="160"`**: The projectile can detect targets within this range.
*   **`homing_velocity_multiplier="1.0"`**: The homing behavior doesn't alter the projectile's base speed.

### Projectile Mechanics (`ProjectileComponent`)

*   **`lob_min="0.8"`, `lob_max="1.0"`**: Controls the arc of the projectile, with a slight upward trajectory.
*   **`speed_min="100"`, `speed_max="120"`**: Defines the projectile's speed range.
*   **`die_on_low_velocity="0"`**: The projectile will not die if its velocity drops too low.
*   **`on_death_explode="1"`**: The projectile explodes when it dies (e.g., on collision).
*   **`on_lifetime_out_explode="1"`**: The projectile also explodes when its lifetime expires.
*   **`explosion_dont_damage_shooter="1"`**: The explosion will not harm the entity that fired it.
*   **`damage="2.8"`**: The base damage dealt by the projectile's explosion.
*   **`on_collision_die="1"`**: The projectile is destroyed upon colliding with something.
*   **`lifetime="300"`**: The projectile exists for 300 frames before expiring.
*   **`knockback_force="1.4"`**: Applies a knockback effect on collision.
*   **`collide_with_tag="player_unit"`**: The projectile will collide with entities tagged as "player_unit".

#### Explosion Configuration (`config_explosion`)

*   **`camera_shake="4.0"`**: The explosion causes significant camera shake.
*   **`explosion_radius="20"`**: The area of effect for the explosion.
*   **`explosion_sprite="data/particles/explosion_032_slime.xml"`**: The visual effect used for the explosion.
*   **`ray_energy="230000"`**: A high energy value, likely contributing to destruction.
*   **`hole_destroy_liquid="1"`**: The explosion can destroy liquids.
*   **`hole_enabled="1"`**: Creates a hole in surfaces where the explosion occurs.
*   **`damage="1.5"`**: The damage dealt by the explosion itself (distinct from projectile damage).
*   **`physics_explosion_power.min="0.4"`, `physics_explosion_power.max="0.6"`**: The force of the physics-based explosion.
*   **`sparks_enabled="1"`**: Sparks are generated by the explosion.
*   **`spark_material="spark_green"`**: The type of sparks generated.
*   **`light_r="35"`, `light_g="240"`, `light_b="140"`**: The color of the light emitted by the explosion.

### Visuals (`SpriteComponent`)

*   **`image_file="data/projectiles_gfx/orb_green_big.xml"`**: Specifies the graphical asset for the projectile.
*   **`rect_animation="fireball"`**: Uses a "fireball" animation.
*   **`emissive="1"`, `additive="1"`**: The sprite is emissive and uses additive blending for a glowing effect.

### Particle Emitter (`SpriteParticleEmitterComponent`)

*   **`sprite_file="data/particles/orb_green_big_out.xml"`**: Defines the particle effect emitted by the projectile.
*   **`is_emitting="1"`**: The particle emitter is active.
*   **`count_min="1"`, `count_max="1"`**: Emits a single particle.
*   **`randomize_rotation`**, **`randomize_angular_velocity`**: Adds some variation to particle rotation.

### Lighting (`LightComponent`)

*   **`radius="150"`**: The radius of the light emitted by the projectile.
*   **`r="10"`, `g="240"`, `b="120"`**: The color of the light (greenish).

### Audio (`AudioComponent`)

*   **`file="data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank"`**: The audio bank containing projectile sounds.
*   **`event_root="projectiles/orb_b"`**: The specific audio event for this projectile.

### Variable Storage (`VariableStorageComponent`)

*   **`name="projectile_file"`**: Stores the path to this entity's XML file, useful for referencing.
*   **`value_string="data/entities/animals/maggot_tiny/orb.xml"`**: The actual path.
