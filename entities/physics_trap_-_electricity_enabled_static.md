# Physics Trap - Electricity Enabled Static

This entity represents a static trap that is activated by electricity and can explode. It's designed to be a hazard that reacts to electrical input.

## Key Components

### PhysicsBody2Component
This component defines the physical properties of the entity.

*   `is_static`: `1` - The entity is fixed in place and does not move.
*   `allow_sleep`: `1` - Allows the physics body to enter a sleep state when inactive to save performance.
*   `fixed_rotation`: `0` - Allows the entity to rotate.
*   `angular_damping`: `0` - No angular damping, meaning it won't slow down its rotation naturally.
*   `linear_damping`: `0` - No linear damping, meaning it won't slow down its movement naturally.

### PhysicsImageShapeComponent
Defines the visual shape and collision properties using an image.

*   `is_root`: `1` - This is the primary shape for the entity.
*   `centered`: `1` - The image is centered on the entity's origin.
*   `image_file`: `data/props_gfx/trap_electricity.png` - The sprite used for this entity.
*   `material`: `steel` - The material type, influencing interactions.

### ElectricityReceiverComponent
Enables the entity to receive and react to electrical signals.

*   `radius`: `6` - The radius within which electrical signals are detected.
*   `active_time_frames`: `100` - The duration (in frames) the entity remains active after receiving a signal.

### LuaComponent
Attaches a Lua script to the entity for custom behavior.

*   `script_source_file`: `data/scripts/props/physics_trap_electricity_pulse.lua` - The script that handles the entity's logic when activated.
*   `execute_every_n_frame`: `128` - The script will execute every 128 frames.
*   `_tags`: `electricity_effect` - A tag indicating its role in electrical effects.

### SpriteParticleEmitterComponent
Responsible for emitting visual particle effects.

*   `sprite_file`: `data/particles/spark_electric.xml` - The particle definition to use.
*   `emission_interval_min_frames`: `128`
*   `emission_interval_max_frames`: `128`
*   `count_min`: `3`
*   `count_max`: `10`
*   `randomize_rotation.min`: `-3.1415`
*   `randomize_rotation.max`: `3.1415`
*   `randomize_position.min_x`: `-14`
*   `randomize_position.max_x`: `14`
*   `randomize_position.min_y`: `-14`
*   `randomize_position.max_y`: `14`

### ParticleEmitterComponent
Another component for emitting particles, likely for more substantial effects.

*   `emitted_material_name`: `spark_electric`
*   `x_vel_min`: `-50`
*   `x_vel_max`: `50`
*   `y_vel_min`: `-100`
*   `y_vel_max`: `50`
*   `count_min`: `20`
*   `count_max`: `60`
*   `lifetime_min`: `0.1`
*   `lifetime_max`: `0.75`
*   `emission_interval_min_frames`: `128`
*   `emission_interval_max_frames`: `128`
*   `is_emitting`: `1`

### DamageModelComponent
Defines how the entity takes damage and its health.

*   `hp`: `30` - The entity's hit points.
*   `materials_that_damage`: `fire,lava,acid` - Materials that can damage this entity.
*   `materials_how_much_damage`: `0.0002,0.0001,0.001` - The damage values for the respective materials.
*   `falling_damages`: `0` - Does not take damage from falling.
*   `fire_damage_amount`: `0.4` - Amount of fire damage it can inflict.
*   `damage_multipliers`:
    *   `melee`: `0.1` - Takes 10% damage from melee attacks.
    *   `electricity`: `0` - Immune to electrical damage.

### ExplodeOnDamageComponent
Configures the entity to explode when it takes sufficient damage.

*   `explode_on_death_percent`: `1` - Will explode when health reaches 0%.
*   `physics_body_destruction_required`: `0.35` - The entity's physics body needs to be at least 35% destroyed for potential explosion.
*   `physics_body_modified_death_probability`: `1.0` - If the destruction threshold is met upon death, there's a 100% chance it will explode.

#### config_explosion
