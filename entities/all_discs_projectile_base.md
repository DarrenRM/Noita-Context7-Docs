# All Discs Projectile Base

This XML defines the base entity for projectiles generated by "all discs" spells in Noita. It serves as a foundational template for various disc-like projectiles, primarily by referencing a Lua script for its core behavior.

## Key Components

### LuaComponent
This is the most critical component, defining the projectile's behavior through an external Lua script.

*   **`script_source_file`**: `data/scripts/projectiles/all_discs.lua` - This points to the main script that governs how these disc projectiles function, including their movement, damage, and interactions.
*   **`execute_every_n_frame`**: `-1` - Indicates that the script's main execution logic does not run on a per-frame basis.
*   **`execute_on_added`**: `1` - The script's `on_added` function will be executed once when the projectile is first created.

### LifetimeComponent
Determines how long the projectile exists before despawning.

*   **`lifetime`**: `2` - The projectile will exist for 2 seconds.

### AudioComponent
Handles the sound effects associated with the projectile.

*   **`file`**: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank` - Specifies the audio bank containing the projectile's sounds.
*   **`event_root`**: `player_projectiles/all_spell` - Sets the root event name for player projectile sounds, allowing for variations based on specific spell types.
*   **`set_latest_event_position`**: `1` - Ensures that the sound event is positioned at the projectile's current location in the game world.

## Entity Tags

*   **`projectile_player`**: This tag identifies the entity as a projectile originating from the player.
