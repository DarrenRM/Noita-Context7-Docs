# Default Projectile Entity

This document describes the default projectile entity in Noita, serving as a base for more complex projectiles.

## Entity Definition

The core entity is named `$projectile_default`.

```xml
<Entity name="$projectile_default">
  ...
</Entity>
```

## ProjectileComponent

This component defines the fundamental behavior of a projectile.

### Key Attributes:

*   `_enabled`: Controls whether the component is active (1) or inactive (0).
*   `speed_min`, `speed_max`: Sets the minimum and maximum initial velocity of the projectile. In this default, both are 0, meaning it doesn't move on its own.
*   `die_on_low_velocity`: If true (1), the projectile is destroyed if its velocity drops too low.
*   `on_death_explode`: If true (1), the projectile explodes upon death.
*   `on_death_gfx_leave_sprite`: If true (1), the projectile's sprite remains after death.
*   `on_lifetime_out_explode`: If true (1), the projectile explodes when its `lifetime` expires.
*   `on_collision_die`: If true (1), the projectile is destroyed upon collision.
*   `damage`: The base damage dealt by the projectile.
*   `lifetime`: The duration in seconds before the projectile expires. A value of 0 means it doesn't expire naturally.

### `config_explosion` (Nested within `ProjectileComponent`)

This sub-component defines the properties of an explosion that can occur when the projectile dies.

#### Key Attributes:

*   `never_cache`: If true (1), the explosion will not be cached, potentially impacting performance but ensuring unique explosions.
*   `damage`: Damage dealt by the explosion.
*   `camera_shake`: The intensity of camera shake caused by the explosion.
*   `explosion_radius`: The radius of the explosion.
*   `explosion_sprite`: The sprite used for the explosion effect.
*   `explosion_sprite_lifetime`: The duration the explosion sprite is visible.
*   `create_cell_material`: The material created at the explosion's origin.
*   `create_cell_probability`: The probability of creating the specified cell material.
*   `hole_destroy_liquid`: If true (1), the explosion destroys liquids.
*   `hole_enabled`: If true (1), the explosion creates holes in terrain.
*   `hole_image`: The image used for the hole effect.
*   `particle_effect`: The particle effect spawned by the explosion.
*   `damage_mortals`: If true (1), the explosion damages living entities.
*   `physics_explosion_power.min`, `physics_explosion_power.max`: The minimum and maximum force applied to physics objects by the explosion.
*   `physics_throw_enabled`: If true (1), physics objects are thrown by the explosion.
*   `shake_vegetation`: If true (1), the explosion shakes vegetation.
*   `sparks_enabled`: If true (1), sparks are generated by the explosion.
*   `stains_enabled`: If true (1), stains are left by the explosion.

## VelocityComponent

This component is present but empty in the default projectile, indicating that its velocity is managed by the `ProjectileComponent` or other external factors.
