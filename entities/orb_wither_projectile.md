# Orb Wither Projectile

This document details the configuration for the "Orb Wither" projectile entity in Noita, focusing on its behavior, appearance, and effects.

## Core Components

### Base Projectile (`<Base file="data/entities/base_projectile.xml">`)

This section inherits fundamental projectile properties.

*   **`VelocityComponent`**:
    *   `gravity_y="0"`: The projectile is not affected by gravity.
    *   `air_friction="-0.1"`: Minimal air resistance.
    *   `mass="0.05"`: A very light projectile.

### Projectile Behavior (`<ProjectileComponent>`)

Defines the projectile's movement, damage, and death conditions.

*   `lob_min="0.8"`, `lob_max="1.0"`: Controls the arc of the projectile.
*   `speed_min="100"`, `speed_max="120"`: Sets the projectile's initial speed range.
*   `die_on_low_velocity="0"`: The projectile does not die if its speed drops too low.
*   `on_death_explode="1"`: The projectile explodes upon death.
*   `on_lifetime_out_explode="1"`: The projectile explodes when its lifetime expires.
*   `explosion_dont_damage_shooter="1"`: The explosion does not harm the entity that fired it.
*   `damage="0.3"`: The base damage dealt by the projectile upon collision.
*   `on_collision_die="1"`: The projectile dies upon colliding with something.
*   `lifetime="150"`: The projectile exists for 150 frames before expiring.

#### Explosion Configuration (`<config_explosion>`)

Details the effects of the projectile's explosion.

*   `never_cache="1"`: Ensures the explosion is always generated fresh.
*   `camera_shake="0.5"`: Causes a moderate camera shake upon explosion.
*   `explosion_radius="1"`: The radius of the explosion effect.
*   `explosion_sprite="data/particles/explosion_032_slimeburst_yellow.xml"`: The visual sprite used for the explosion.
*   `hole_destroy_liquid="1"`: The explosion can destroy liquids.
*   `hole_enabled="1"`: Creates a hole in surfaces where the explosion occurs.
*   `damage="0.1"`: The damage dealt by the explosion itself.
*   `ray_energy="10000"`: High energy for potential ray interactions.
*   `damage_mortals="1"`: The explosion damages living entities.
*   `shake_vegetation="1"`: The explosion shakes vegetation.
*   `sparks_enabled="1"`: Sparks are generated by the explosion.
*   `sparks_count_min="12"`, `sparks_count_max="16"`: The number of sparks generated.
*   `light_r="180"`, `light_g="180"`, `light_b="180"`: The color of the light emitted by the explosion.

### Homing Behavior (`<HomingComponent>`)

Allows the projectile to track targets.

*   `target_tag="prey"`: The projectile targets entities with the "prey" tag.
*   `homing_targeting_coeff="9"`: A strong coefficient for targeting.
*   `detect_distance="350"`: The distance at which the projectile can detect targets.
*   `homing_velocity_multiplier="1.0"`: The projectile's velocity is not significantly altered by homing.

## Visuals and Effects

### Sprite (`<SpriteComponent>`)

Defines the projectile's visual appearance.

*   `image_file="data/projectiles_gfx/orb_yellow.xml"`: Specifies the sprite asset.
*   `rect_animation="fireball"`: Uses a "fireball" animation.
*   `emissive="1"`, `additive="1"`: The sprite is emissive and uses additive blending for a glowing effect.

### Particle Emitter (`<SpriteParticleEmitterComponent>`)

Generates particles around the projectile.

*   `sprite_file="data/particles/tinyspark_01.xml"`: The sprite used for emitted particles.
*   `emission_interval_min_frames="3"`, `emission_interval_max_frames="4"`: Controls the frequency of particle emission.
*   `count_min="1"`, `count_max="2"`: The number of particles emitted per interval.
*   `randomize_rotation.min="-3.1415"`, `randomize_rotation.max="3.1415"`: Particles are emitted with random rotations.
*   `randomize_position.min_x="-8"`, `randomize_position.max_x="8"`: Particles are emitted within a small random area around the projectile.

### Light Component (`<LightComponent>`)

Adds a light source to the projectile.

*   `radius="150"`: The radius of the light.
*   `r="220"`, `g="180"`, `b="40"`: The color of the light (yellowish).

## Audio

### Audio Component (`<AudioComponent>`)

Plays a sound effect when the projectile is created.

*   `file="data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank"`: The audio bank file.
*   `event_root="projectiles/magic"`: The root event for magic projectile sounds.

### Audio Loop Component (`<AudioLoopComponent>`)

Plays a looping sound effect while the projectile is active.

*   `file="data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank"`: The audio bank file.
*   `event_name="projectiles/magic_orb/loop"`: The specific looping sound event.
*   `auto_play="1"`: The sound starts automatically.

## Special Effects

### Hit Effect Component (`<HitEffectComponent>`)

Applies a special effect upon hitting a target.

*   `effect_hit="LOAD_UNIQUE_CHILD_ENTITY"`: Loads a unique child entity as the hit effect.
*   `value_string="data/entities/misc/effect_wither.xml"`: Specifies the entity to load, which is `effect_wither.xml`.

## Variables

### Variable Storage Component (`<VariableStorageComponent>`)

Stores variables associated with this entity.
