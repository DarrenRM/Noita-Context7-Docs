# Swarm Wasp Projectile

This document details the `swarm_wasp.xml` entity, which defines the behavior and appearance of the Swarm Wasp projectile in Noita.

## Core Components

The Swarm Wasp projectile is a complex entity with several key components that dictate its functionality:

### Base Projectile (`BaseComponent`)

*   **`gravity_y`**: `50` - Controls the downward acceleration due to gravity.
*   **`air_friction`**: `2` - Represents the resistance from air, affecting its speed.
*   **`mass`**: `0.03` - The projectile's mass, influencing its interaction with physics.

### Homing Behavior (`HomingComponent`)

This component allows the projectile to track and pursue its target.

*   **`target_who_shot`**: `1` - Indicates that the projectile targets the entity that fired it.
*   **`homing_targeting_coeff`**: `10.0` - A coefficient that determines the strength of the homing behavior. Higher values mean more aggressive tracking.
*   **`detect_distance`**: `300` - The maximum distance at which the projectile can detect its target.

### Projectile Mechanics (`ProjectileComponent`)

This is the primary component defining the projectile's flight, damage, and death behaviors.

*   **`speed_min` / `speed_max`**: `50` / `150` - The range of initial speeds for the projectile.
*   **`direction_random_rad`**: `0.8` - Introduces randomness to the projectile's initial direction.
*   **`on_death_explode`**: `1` - The projectile will explode upon death.
*   **`on_lifetime_out_explode`**: `1` - The projectile will explode when its lifetime expires.
*   **`lifetime`**: `1100` - The maximum duration the projectile exists in frames.
*   **`damage`**: `0.0` - The base damage dealt by the projectile.
*   **`bounce_always`**: `1` - The projectile will always bounce off surfaces.
*   **`bounces_left`**: `10` - The maximum number of bounces the projectile can perform.
*   **`knockback_force`**: `0.4` - The force applied to entities upon collision.
*   **`physics_impulse_coeff`**: `1200` - Affects how much physics impulse is applied on collision.
*   **`damage_every_x_frames`**: `20` - The projectile deals damage every 20 frames.

#### Damage by Type

*   **`melee`**: `0.28` - The amount of melee damage the projectile deals.

#### Explosion Configuration (`config_explosion`)

Defines the parameters for the projectile's explosion.

*   **`load_this_entity`**: `data/entities/particles/swarm_poof.xml` - Specifies the entity to load for the explosion effect.
*   **`spark_material`**: `plasma_fading_pink` - The material used for sparks generated by the explosion.

### Visual Representation (`SpriteComponent`)

*   **`image_file`**: `data/projectiles_gfx/swarm_wasp.xml` - Points to the XML file defining the projectile's sprite and animations.

### Audio (`AudioComponent`, `AudioLoopComponent`)

*   **`AudioComponent`**: Handles the initial sound effect of the projectile.
    *   **`file`**: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank`
    *   **`event_root`**: `player_projectiles/bullet_smg`
*   **`AudioLoopComponent`**: Provides a continuous looping sound effect during flight.
    *   **`file`**: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank`
    *   **`event_name`**: `player_projectiles/fly/movement_loop`

### Particle Effects (`ParticleEmitterComponent`)

This component generates cosmetic particles, likely for a trail effect.

*   **`emitted_material_name`**: `spark_red` - The material of the emitted particles.
*   **`is_trail`**: `1` - Indicates that these particles form a trail.
*   **`emit_cosmetic_particles`**: `1` - Ensures these are cosmetic particles, not affecting gameplay directly.

### Damageable Properties (`DamageModelComponent`)

*   **`hp`**: `0.7` - The hit points of the projectile, determining how much damage it can sustain before being destroyed.

### Collision Box (`HitboxComponent`)

Defines the area where the projectile can collide with other entities.

*   **`aabb_min_x` / `aabb_max_x`**: `-3` / `3` - The bounding box dimensions in the X-axis.
*   **`aabb_min_y` / `aabb_max_y`**: `-3` / `3` - The bounding box dimensions in the Y-axis.

### Scripting (`LuaComponent`)

*   **`script_source_file`**: `data/scripts/projectiles/swarm_fly.lua` - Links to an external Lua script that likely controls more complex behaviors or custom logic for the swarm fly.
*   **`execute_every_n_frame`**: `3` - The script will execute every 3 frames.

### Variable Storage (`VariableStorageComponent`)

*   **`projectile_file`**: `data/entities/projectiles/deck/swarm_wasp.xml` - Stores the path to this entity's definition, potentially for use by other scripts or systems.
