# Physics Mining Lamp

This entity represents a physics-based mining lamp that can be interacted with in the game world. It has properties related to its physical behavior, light emission, material contents, damage, and explosive potential.

## Key Components and Attributes

### Base Item Physics

This component inherits fundamental physics properties from a base item.

*   **`PhysicsImageShapeComponent`**: Defines the visual representation and physical material of the lamp.
    *   `image_file`: `data/props_gfx/minelamp.png` - Specifies the sprite used for the lamp.
    *   `material`: `wood_prop` - The material type, influencing its physical interactions.
*   **`PhysicsBodyComponent`**: Controls the physical dynamics of the lamp.
    *   `angular_damping`: `0.01` - Reduces rotational velocity over time.
    *   `gridworld_box2d`: `0` - Indicates it's not constrained to a grid for physics.
    *   `linear_damping`: `0.1` - Reduces linear velocity over time.
    *   `initial_velocity.x`, `initial_velocity.y`: `10` - Sets an initial velocity upon spawning.
    *   `randomize_init_velocity`: `1` - Randomizes the initial velocity within a range.

### Physics Joint Component

This component allows the lamp to be attached to walls.

*   `nail_to_wall`: `1` - Enables the "nailing" behavior to walls.
*   `pos_x`, `pos_y`: `2.5`, `-2` - Offset from the entity's origin for the joint.

### Light Component

Controls the light emitted by the lamp.

*   `_enabled`: `1` - The light component is active.
*   `radius`: `100` - The range of the light.

### Material Inventory Component

Manages the materials contained within the lamp.

*   `_enabled`: `1` - The inventory component is active.
*   `drop_as_item`: `0` - The contents are not dropped as a single item upon death.
*   `on_death_spill`: `1` - Contents will spill out when the entity dies.
*   `leak_on_damage_percent`: `0.999` - The lamp will leak its contents when 99.9% damaged.
*   **`count_per_material_type`**: Defines the materials and their quantities.
    *   `Material material="oil" count="5"`: Contains 5 units of "oil".

### Damage Model Component

Defines how the lamp takes damage and reacts to it.

*   `air_needed`: `0` - Does not require air to function or take damage.
*   `blood_material`: `oil` - The material associated with "blood" for damage effects.
*   `falling_damage_damage_max`, `falling_damage_damage_min`: `1.2`, `0.1` - Range of damage from falling.
*   `falling_damage_height_max`, `falling_damage_height_min`: `250`, `70` - Height thresholds for falling damage.
*   `fire_damage_amount`: `0.2` - Amount of damage taken from fire.
*   `hp`: `0.7` - The hit points of the lamp.
*   `critical_damage_resistance`: `1` - High resistance to critical damage.

### Explode On Damage Component

Determines if and how the lamp explodes.

*   `explode_on_death_percent`: `1` - Will explode upon death.
*   `explode_on_damage_percent`: `0.0` - Can explode from damage (though `explode_on_death_percent` is more dominant here).
*   `physics_body_modified_death_probability`: `0.95` - High chance of explosion if its physics body is modified upon death.
*   `physics_body_destruction_required`: `0.3` - Requires 30% of its physics body to be destroyed for explosion.
*   **`config_explosion`**: Configuration for the explosion effect.
    *   `damage`: `1` - Base damage of the explosion.
    *   `camera_shake`: `5` - Intensity of camera shake.
    *   `explosion_radius`: `5` - The radius of the explosion.
    *   `explosion_sprite`: `data/particles/explosion_008.xml` - The particle effect for the explosion.
    *   `ray_energy`: `100000` - Energy of the explosion rays.
    *   `physics_explosion_power.min`, `physics_explosion_power.max`: `0.08`, `0.15` - Minimum and maximum physics force applied by the explosion.
    *   `sparks_enabled`: `1` - Sparks are generated by the explosion.

### Camera Bound Component

Manages the entity's visibility and interaction range with the camera.

*   `max_count`: `100` - Maximum number of such entities that can be active.
*   `distance`: `1000` - The distance at which the entity is considered by the camera.

### Lua Component

Attaches custom Lua scripting to the entity.

*   `script_physics_body_modified`: `data/scripts/props/physics_lantern_damaged.lua` - A script that runs when the entity's physics body is modified, likely for handling damage effects.
