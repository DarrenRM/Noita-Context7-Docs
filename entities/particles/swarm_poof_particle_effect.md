# Swarm Poof Particle Effect

This entity defines a particle effect that creates a "poof" of purple sparks. It's primarily used for visual flair and doesn't have significant gameplay impact.

## Key Components

### ProjectileComponent

This component defines the projectile-like behavior of the entity. In this case, it's configured to exist for a short duration and then explode, triggering the particle emitters.

| Attribute                 | Value   | Description                                                                 |

| `speed_min`, `speed_max`  | `0`     | The projectile has no initial velocity.                                     |
| `die_on_low_velocity`     | `0`     | The projectile does not die when its velocity becomes low.                  |
| `on_death_explode`        | `0`     | The projectile does not explode upon death (this is handled by `on_lifetime_out_explode`). |
| `on_lifetime_out_explode` | `1`     | The projectile explodes when its lifetime expires.                          |
| `lifetime`                | `2`     | The duration in seconds before the projectile explodes.                     |

#### `config_explosion` (within `ProjectileComponent`)

This sub-component defines the properties of the explosion that occurs when the projectile's lifetime ends.

| Attribute              | Value   | Description                                                                 |

| `particle_effect`      | `0`     | No additional particle effect is spawned by the explosion itself.           |
| `damage_mortals`       | `0`     | The explosion does not damage mortals.                                      |
| `physics_throw_enabled`| `0`     | The explosion does not throw physics objects.                               |
| `sparks_enabled`       | `0`     | No sparks are generated by the explosion.                                   |
| `stains_enabled`       | `0`     | No stains are left by the explosion.                                        |

### ParticleEmitterComponent (x2)

This component is responsible for emitting particles. This entity uses two `ParticleEmitterComponent` instances to create a layered effect.

This emitter creates the main burst of purple sparks.
