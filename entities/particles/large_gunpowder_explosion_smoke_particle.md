# Large Gunpowder Explosion Smoke Particle

This entity defines a specific type of smoke particle generated by a large gunpowder explosion in Noita. It inherits its base properties from `explosion_smoke_gunpowder.xml` and modifies its initial velocity.

## Key Attributes

### Base Entity

*   **`file`**: `data/entities/particles/particle_explosion/explosion_smoke_gunpowder.xml`
    *   This indicates that this particle inherits all properties from the base gunpowder smoke particle.

### Velocity Component

*   **`SetStartVelocityComponent`**: This component controls the initial speed of the spawned particles.
    *   **`randomize_speed.min`**: `200` - The minimum initial speed for the smoke particles.
    *   **`randomize_speed.max`**: `900` - The maximum initial speed for the smoke particles.

## Summary

This particle is a variation of the standard gunpowder smoke, specifically designed to have a wider range of initial velocities, making the explosion's smoke appear more dispersed and dynamic.
