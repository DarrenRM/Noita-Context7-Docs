# Big TNT Box Projectile

This document details the `tntbox_big.xml` entity, representing a large TNT box projectile in Noita.

## Core Attributes

This projectile is designed to be thrown and explode on impact or after a certain amount of damage.

*   **`tags`**: `hittable`, `teleportable_NOT`, `mortal`, `item_physics`, `projectile`, `projectile_player` - Defines its physical properties and interactions.
*   **`lifetime`**: `-1` - The projectile does not despawn on its own.
*   **`penetrate_entities`**: `0` - It will not pass through other entities.
*   **`damage`**: `0.0` - The projectile itself deals no direct damage.
*   **`on_lifetime_out_explode`**: `1` - Will explode when its lifetime runs out (though lifetime is -1 here, so this is less relevant than damage-based explosions).
*   **`explosion_dont_damage_shooter`**: `0` - The explosion *can* damage the entity that threw it.
*   **`friendly_fire`**: `1` - The explosion can damage friendly entities.
*   **`collide_with_shooter_frames`**: `6` - The projectile will collide with the shooter for 6 frames.
*   **`on_collision_die`**: `0` - Does not die upon collision.

## Physics Components

These components define how the TNT box behaves physically.

### `PhysicsBodyComponent`

*   **`hax_fix_going_through_ground`**: `0` - Standard ground collision behavior.
*   **`projectiles_rotate_toward_velocity`**: `1` - The projectile will orient itself to face its direction of movement.

### `PhysicsImageShapeComponent`

*   **`image_file`**: `data/props_gfx/tnt_box_big.png` - The visual asset for the TNT box.
*   **`material`**: `wood_prop_noplayerhit` - Defines its material properties, preventing player hits from affecting it directly.

### `PhysicsThrowableComponent`

*   **`max_throw_speed`**: `80` - The maximum speed it can be thrown.
*   **`throw_force_coeff`**: `1` - Coefficient for throw force.
*   **`min_torque`**: `6` - Minimum rotational force when thrown.
*   **`max_torque`**: `9` - Maximum rotational force when thrown.

## Damage and Explosion

The TNT box's primary function is its explosive potential.

### `DamageModelComponent`

*   **`hp`**: `10.9` - The amount of damage the TNT box can sustain before triggering its explosion.
*   **`damage_multipliers`**: `melee="0.1"` - Reduces damage taken from melee attacks.

### `ExplodeOnDamageComponent`

This component dictates the explosion behavior when the TNT box takes damage.

*   **`explode_on_death_percent`**: `1` - Will explode if it reaches 0 HP.
*   **`explode_on_damage_percent`**: `0.1` - Will explode when it has taken 10% of its total HP in damage.
*   **`physics_body_modified_death_probability`**: `0.9` - High chance of exploding if its physics body is modified upon death.
*   **`physics_body_destruction_required`**: `0.3` - Requires 30% of its physics body to be destroyed to trigger an explosion.

### `ExplosionComponent`

This component defines the explosion's properties when triggered (e.g., `ON_DEATH`).

*   **`damage`**: `8` - The base damage dealt by the explosion.
*   **`camera_shake`**: `15` - Intensity of camera shake upon explosion.
*   **`explosion_radius`**: `60` - The area of effect for the explosion.
*   **`explosion_sprite`**: `data/particles/explosion_040_poof.xml` - Visual effect for the explosion.
*   **`load_this_entity`**: `data/entities/particles/particle_explosion/main_gunpowder_medium.xml` - Entity to load for the explosion effect.
*   **`hole_destroy_liquid`**: `1` - The explosion can destroy liquids.
*   **`ray_energy`**: `650000` - Energy value related to the explosion's destructive power.
*   **`hole_enabled`**: `1` - Creates holes in terrain.
*   **`particle_effect`**: `1` - Enables particle effects for the explosion.
*   **`damage_mortals`**: `1` - The explosion damages living entities.
*   **`physics_throw_enabled`**: `1` - The explosion can affect physics objects.
*   **`sparks_enabled`**: `1` - Sparks are generated by the explosion.

## Other Components

*   **`GenomeDataComponent`**: `herd_id="player"` - Associates this item with the player's herd.
*   **`AudioComponent`**: Plays projectile sounds.
*   **`UIInfoComponent`**: `name="$item_tntbox_big"` - Sets the in-game name for the item.
*   **`VariableStorageComponent`**: `projectile_file="data/entities/projectiles/deck/tntbox_big.xml"` - Stores the path to this entity's file.
