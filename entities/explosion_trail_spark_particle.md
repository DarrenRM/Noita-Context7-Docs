# Explosion Trail Spark Particle

This entity defines a specific type of particle used in explosions, inheriting its base properties from `base_spark_trail.xml`.

## Key Attributes

The `explosion_trail_spark.xml` file is very minimal, indicating that all its functional behavior and visual properties are inherited from its base file.

### Inheritance

*   **`Base file="data/entities/particles/particle_explosion/base_spark_trail.xml"`**: This is the primary element, specifying that this particle's definition is entirely derived from `base_spark_trail.xml`. Any modifications or specific behaviors for this "explosion trail spark" would need to be defined in that base file or through additional components not present here.

This entity serves as a specialized variant of a spark trail particle, likely used to create a visual effect during explosions. Its specific appearance and behavior are dictated by the `base_spark_trail.xml` file.
