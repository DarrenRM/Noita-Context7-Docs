# Green Poof Particle Effect

This entity defines a visual particle effect that resembles a "poof" of green sparks. It's primarily used for cosmetic purposes and doesn't deal damage or interact physically with the environment in a significant way.

## Key Components

### ProjectileComponent

This component defines the projectile-like behavior of the entity. In this case, it's configured to exist for a short duration and then trigger an explosion, which in turn spawns the particles.
