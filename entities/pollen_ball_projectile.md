# Pollen Ball Projectile

This document details the configuration of the "Pollen Ball" projectile entity in Noita, focusing on its behavior, appearance, and effects.

## Entity Definition

The `pollen_ball.xml` file defines a projectile entity with various components that govern its movement, impact, and visual representation.

```xml
<Entity 
  name="$projectile_default" 
   >
  <!-- ... other components ... -->
</Entity>
```

## Key Components and Attributes

### Base Projectile (`BaseComponent`)

This component inherits fundamental projectile properties.

*   **`VelocityComponent`**:
    *   `mass`: `0.07` - A very low mass, contributing to its projectile behavior.
    *   `air_friction`: `0.0` - No air resistance, allowing it to maintain velocity.

### Projectile Behavior (`ProjectileComponent`)

This is the core component defining the projectile's unique characteristics.

*   **Movement & Trajectory**:
    *   `lob_min`, `lob_max`: `0.2`, `0.5` - Controls the arc of the projectile.
    *   `speed_min`, `speed_max`: `80`, `90` - Defines the initial velocity range.
    *   `friction`: `0.6` - Some in-air deceleration.
    *   `direction_random_rad`: `0.15` - Introduces slight randomness to the projectile's direction.
    *   `bounces_left`: `2` - The projectile can bounce a maximum of 2 times.

*   **Impact & Death**:
    *   `on_death_explode`: `1` - The projectile explodes upon death.
    *   `on_lifetime_out_explode`: `1` - Explodes when its lifetime expires.
    *   `on_collision_die`: `1` - Dies and explodes upon hitting a surface.
    *   `lifetime`: `500` - The maximum duration in frames before expiring.
    *   `lifetime_randomness`: `7` - Adds slight variation to the lifetime.

*   **Damage & Effects**:
    *   `damage`: `1.2` - The base damage dealt by the projectile.
    *   `knockback_force`: `2.0` - The force applied to entities upon impact.
    *   `camera_shake_when_shot`: `5.0` - Triggers camera shake when the projectile is fired.
    *   `explosion_dont_damage_shooter`: `0` - The explosion can damage the shooter.

*   **Explosion Configuration (`config_explosion`)**:
    *   `explosion_radius`: `4` - The radius of the explosion.
    *   `explosion_sprite`: `data/particles/explosion_032_glue.xml` - The visual effect for the explosion.
    *   `load_this_entity`: `data/entities/misc/pollen_ball_burst.xml` - An entity spawned upon explosion, likely for more complex effects.
    *   `camera_shake`: `10` - Intensity of camera shake during explosion.
    *   `ray_energy`: `25000` - Energy value for any raycasting effects from the explosion.
    *   `damage`: `0.0` - The explosion itself does no direct damage (damage is likely handled by `load_this_entity`).
    *   `physics_explosion_power.min`, `.max`: `0.15`, `0.35` - Controls the physics force of the explosion.
    *   `sparks_enabled`: `1` - Sparks are generated by the explosion.
    *   `stains_enabled`: `1` - Creates stains on surfaces after the explosion.
    *   `audio_event_name`: `explosions/grenade_small` - The sound effect played for the explosion.

### Visual Representation (`SpriteComponent`)

Defines the projectile's appearance.

*   `image_file`: `data/projectiles_gfx/pollen_ball.xml` - Specifies the sprite sheet or animation file.
*   `alpha`: `1` - Fully opaque.

### Particle Emission (`ParticleEmitterComponent`)

Controls the emission of particles from the projectile.

*   `emitted_material_name`: `acid_gas` - The type of material that forms the emitted particles.
*   `count_min`, `count_max`: `1`, `1` - Emits a single particle per emission.
*   `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max`: `0.1`, `0.3` - Short lifespan for emitted particles.
*   `is_emitting`: `1` - The emitter is active.

### Audio (`AudioComponent`)

Handles sound effects associated with the projectile.

*   `file`: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank` - The audio bank containing the sound events.
*   `event_root`: `projectiles/bullet_arrow` - The root event name for projectile sounds.

### Variable Storage (`VariableStorageComponent`)

Stores custom variables for the entity.

*   `name`: `projectile_file`
*   `value_string`: `data/entities/projectiles/pollen_ball.xml` - Stores the path to this entity's definition.
