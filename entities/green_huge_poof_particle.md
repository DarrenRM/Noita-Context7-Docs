# Green Huge Poof Particle

This entity defines a particle effect that creates a large, green "poof" or explosion of sparks. It's designed to be a visual effect rather than a damaging one.

## Key Components

### ProjectileComponent
This component governs the projectile-like behavior of the entity.

| Attribute              | Value   | Description                                                                 |

| `_enabled`             | `1`     | Enables the component.                                                      |
| `speed_min`, `speed_max` | `0`     | The particle has no initial velocity.                                       |
| `lifetime`             | `5`     | The particle exists for 5 seconds.                                          |
| `on_lifetime_out_explode` | `1`     | The particle will explode when its lifetime runs out.                       |
| `damage`               | `0`     | The particle itself does not deal damage.                                   |

#### config_explosion
This sub-component defines the properties of the explosion that occurs when `on_lifetime_out_explode` is triggered.

| Attribute              | Value   | Description                                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `damage`               | `0`     | The explosion does not deal damage.                                         |
| `camera_shake`         | `0`     | No camera shake is applied.                                                 |
| `explosion_radius`     | `0`     | The explosion has no radius.                                                |
| `particle_effect`      | `0`     | No additional particle effects are spawned by the explosion itself.         |
| `damage_mortals`       | `0`     | The explosion does not damage living entities.                              |
| `physics_explosion_power.max` | `0`     | No physics-based force is applied by the explosion.                         |
| `sparks_enabled`       | `0`     | No sparks are generated by the explosion itself.                            |

### ParticleEmitterComponent
This component is responsible for generating the actual visual particles that form the "poof".

| Attribute              | Value   | Description                                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `emitted_material_name` | `spark_green` | The material used for the emitted particles.                                |
| `gravity.y`            | `200.0` | The particles are affected by gravity, pulling them downwards.              |
| `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max` | `0.5` - `1.5` | Individual particles last between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds.                      |
| `count_min`, `count_max` | `155` - `185` | A large number of particles are emitted.                                    |
| `area_circle_radius.max` | `12`    | Particles are emitted within a circular area with a maximum radius of 12.   |
| `cosmetic_force_create` | `1`     | Ensures particles are created even if conditions might otherwise prevent it. |
| `airflow_force`, `airflow_time`, `airflow_scale` | `3.5`, `1.9`, `0.15` | Particles are influenced by airflow for a duration, with a scaling effect. |
