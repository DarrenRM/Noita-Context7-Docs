# Nuke Projectile

This document details the configuration of the "Nuke" projectile entity in Noita, focusing on its core attributes and behaviors relevant to AI-assisted modding.

## Core Attributes

The Nuke projectile is a powerful, player-fired entity designed for significant area-of-effect damage.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `$projectile_default` | Base projectile name, often overridden by specific tags. |
| `tags` | `projectile_player,nuke` | Identifies this as a player projectile and specifically as a "nuke". |

## Velocity Component

Controls the physical movement and interaction of the projectile.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gravity_y` | `120` | The downward acceleration due to gravity. |
| `air_friction` | `0.00001` | Minimal air resistance. |
| `mass` | `0.2` | The projectile's mass, influencing its momentum. |

## Projectile Component

Defines the projectile's behavior, including its trajectory, damage, and death effects.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `lob_min`, `lob_max` | `0.8`, `1.0` | Controls the minimum and maximum "lob" or arc of the projectile. |
| `speed_min`, `speed_max` | `300`, `300` | The projectile's constant speed. |
| `direction_random_rad` | `0.01` | Small randomness in projectile direction. |
| `on_death_explode` | `1` | The projectile explodes upon death. |
| `on_lifetime_out_explode` | `1` | The projectile explodes when its lifetime expires. |
| `on_collision_die` | `1` | The projectile dies upon collision. |
| `lifetime` | `360` | The maximum duration the projectile exists before expiring. |
| `damage` | `3` | Base damage dealt by the projectile itself (distinct from explosion damage). |
| `camera_shake_when_shot` | `5.0` | Camera shake effect when the projectile is fired. |
| `knockback_force` | `1.5` | The force applied to entities upon collision or explosion. |

### `config_explosion` (Nested within `ProjectileComponent`)

Details the parameters of the explosion triggered by the projectile.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `never_cache` | `1` | Prevents caching of this explosion for performance. |
| `camera_shake` | `60` | Significant camera shake upon explosion. |
| `explosion_radius` | `250` | The radius of the explosion's effect. |
| `explosion_sprite` | `data/particles/explosion_032.xml` | The visual sprite used for the explosion. |

| `ray_energy` | `6700000` | High energy value, likely contributing to destruction capabilities. |
| `damage` | `10` | Damage dealt by the explosion itself. |
| `physics_explosion_power.min`, `physics_explosion_power.max` | `4.5`, `9` | The range of force applied to physics objects by the explosion. |
