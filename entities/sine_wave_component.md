# Sine Wave Component

This component allows an entity to emit a sine wave effect.

## SineWaveComponent

This is the primary component for creating sine wave effects.

### Key Attributes:

*   `_enabled`: Controls whether the component is active.
*   `sinewave_freq`: Determines the frequency of the sine wave. A higher value means more oscillations.
*   `sinewave_m`: Controls the amplitude or magnitude of the sine wave.
*   `lifetime`: The duration the sine wave effect will last. `-1` indicates it will last indefinitely.
