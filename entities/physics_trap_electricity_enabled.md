# Physics Trap Electricity Enabled

This entity represents an electrical trap that can be activated by receiving electricity. When activated, it emits electrical particles and can trigger an explosion upon taking sufficient damage.

## Key Components

### PhysicsBody2Component
Manages the physical properties of the entity.

*   `allow_sleep`: Whether the body can enter a sleep state when inactive.
*   `angular_damping`: Resistance to rotational movement.
*   `linear_damping`: Resistance to linear movement.

### PhysicsImageShapeComponent
Defines the visual representation and collision shape of the entity.

*   `is_root`: Indicates if this is the primary shape component.
*   `centered`: Whether the image is centered on the entity's origin.
*   `image_file`: Path to the sprite image.
*   `material`: The material type for physics interactions.

### ElectricityReceiverComponent
Enables the entity to react to incoming electricity.

*   `radius`: The area around the entity that can receive electricity.
