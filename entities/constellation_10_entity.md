# Constellation 10 Entity

This entity defines a visual element for the game's introduction, specifically a "constellation" effect. It inherits its base properties from `constellation_base.xml` and adds a specific particle emitter.

## Key Components

### Base Entity

*   **`file="data/entities/intro/constellation_base.xml"`**: Inherits core properties and behaviors from a base constellation entity. This likely includes its visual representation, collision, and other fundamental aspects.

### Particle Emitter Component

*   **`image_animation_file="data/entities/intro/01_06.png"`**: This is the primary customization for this specific constellation. It points to a PNG file containing an animation sequence for the particles. This file likely dictates the visual appearance and animation of the glowing points that form the constellation.

## Usage

This entity is intended for use within the game's introductory sequences, contributing to the visual storytelling and atmosphere. The specific animation file suggests a particular visual style for this constellation.
