# Pink Firework Particle

This entity defines the visual and behavioral aspects of a pink firework particle effect in Noita. It primarily uses `ProjectileComponent` for its lifetime and explosion behavior, and `ParticleEmitterComponent` to generate the visual particles that constitute the firework.

## ProjectileComponent

This component governs the projectile's movement, lifetime, and death behavior.
