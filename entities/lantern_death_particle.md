# Lantern Death Particle

This entity defines the visual and behavioral aspects of particles emitted when a lantern entity dies. It primarily uses a `ProjectileComponent` to manage its lifetime and a `ParticleEmitterComponent` to generate the visual sparks.

## Key Components and Attributes

### ProjectileComponent

This component governs the projectile-like behavior of the particle itself.

| Attribute             | Description                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lifetime`            | The duration (in seconds) this particle exists before expiring.           |
| `on_lifetime_out_explode` | If `1`, the particle will explode when its lifetime ends.                |
| `speed_min`, `speed_max` | Set to `0`, indicating the particle itself doesn't move with velocity. |
| `die_on_low_velocity` | Set to `0`, meaning it won't die if its velocity drops.                  |
| `on_death_explode`    | Set to `0`, the particle does not explode upon its own death.            |
| `on_collision_die`    | Set to `0`, the particle does not die upon collision.                    |
| `damage`              | Set to `0`, this particle does not inflict damage.                       |

#### config_explosion

This nested configuration defines the properties of an explosion, though most are disabled or set to zero for this particle.

| Attribute             | Description                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `damage`              | Set to `0`, no damage is dealt by the explosion.                         |
| `explosion_radius`    | Set to `0`, no area of effect for the explosion.                         |
| `particle_effect`     | Set to `0`, no additional particles are created by the explosion.        |
| `damage_mortals`      | Set to `0`, no damage to living entities.                                |
| `physics_explosion_power.max` | Set to `0`, no physics-based force is applied.                       |
| `sparks_enabled`      | Set to `0`, no sparks are generated by the explosion.                    |

### VelocityComponent

This component is present but has no effect on the particle's movement.

| Attribute | Description                               |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `gravity_y` | Set to `0`, no vertical gravity applied. |

### ParticleEmitterComponent

This component is responsible for generating the visual "spark" particles.

| Attribute                 | Description                                                                                             |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `emitted_material_name`   | The material of the particles to be emitted (`spark`).                                                  |
| `gravity.y`               | The vertical gravity applied to the emitted particles.                                                  |
| `x_vel_min`, `x_vel_max`  | The minimum and maximum horizontal velocity of emitted particles.                                       |
| `y_vel_min`, `y_vel_max`  | The minimum and maximum vertical velocity of emitted particles.                                         |
| `count_min`, `count_max`  | The range for the number of particles emitted per emission cycle.                                       |
| `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max` | The range for the lifetime of individual emitted particles.                                             |
| `emit_cosmetic_particles` | Set to `1`, indicating these are visual effects and not gameplay-affecting particles.                   |
| `render_on_grid`          | Set to `1`, particles are rendered on the game grid.                                                    |
| `is_emitting`             | Set to `1`, the emitter is active.                                                                      |
| `emission_interval_min_frames`, `emission_interval_max_frames` | Controls how frequently particles are emitted. Set to `1` for continuous emission. |
| `x_pos_offset_min`, `x_pos_offset_max` | Offset for horizontal position of emitted particles.                                    |
