# Pata Rocket 1 Projectile

This document details the configuration of the "Pata Rocket 1" projectile entity in Noita, focusing on its core attributes and behaviors for AI-assisted modding.

## Core Entity Attributes

The projectile is defined as an `Entity` with the following key tags:

*   `projectile_player`: Indicates it's a projectile fired by the player.
*   `rocket`: Identifies it as a rocket-type projectile.

## Base Projectile Configuration

The projectile inherits base properties from `data/entities/base_projectile.xml`.

### Velocity Component

*   `gravity_y`: `50` - Applies a downward gravitational pull.
*   `air_friction`: `-5.0` - Reduces velocity due to air resistance.
*   `mass`: `0.05` - Defines the projectile's mass.

## Projectile Component

This component governs the projectile's specific behaviors and effects.

### Key Attributes:

*   `lob_min`, `lob_max`: `0.8` to `1.0` - Controls the projectile's arc.
*   `speed_min`, `speed_max`: `70` to `100` - Sets the projectile's initial speed range.
*   `on_death_explode`: `1` - The projectile explodes upon death.
*   `on_lifetime_out_explode`: `1` - The projectile explodes when its lifetime expires.
*   `on_collision_die`: `1` - The projectile is destroyed upon collision.
*   `lifetime`: `40` - The base duration of the projectile before expiring.
*   `lifetime_randomness`: `20` - Adds randomness to the projectile's lifetime.
*   `damage`: `5` - The base damage dealt by the projectile.
*   `camera_shake_when_shot`: `15.0` - Triggers camera shake when the projectile is fired.
*   `knockback_force`: `4.0` - The force applied to knock back entities upon impact.
*   `physics_impulse_coeff`: `5000` - Coefficient for physics impulse calculations.

#### Explosion Configuration (`config_explosion`)

*   `camera_shake`: `90` - Intensity of camera shake during explosion.
*   `explosion_radius`: `30` - The radius of the explosion's effect.
*   `explosion_sprite`: `data/particles/explosion_032_pink.xml` - The visual sprite for the explosion.
*   `load_this_entity`: `data/entities/particles/particle_explosion/main_swirly_purple_giga.xml` - The entity to load upon explosion.
*   `ray_energy`: `6200000` - Energy value for raycasting effects during explosion.
*   `damage`: `5.2` - Damage dealt by the explosion.
*   `physics_explosion_power.min`, `physics_explosion_power.max`: `1.0` to `1.4` - Controls the physics force of the explosion.
*   `sparks_count_min`, `sparks_count_max`: `60` to `90` - Number of sparks generated by the explosion.
*   `spark_material`: `spark_purple_bright` - The material used for sparks.
*   `stains_radius`: `20` - The radius of stains left by the explosion.
*   `audio_event_name`: `explosions/magic_rocket_big` - The audio event triggered by the explosion.

## Sprite Component

*   `image_file`: `data/projectiles_gfx/fireball_small.xml` - Specifies the visual sprite for the projectile.

## Light Component

*   `r`, `g`, `b`: `100`, `10`, `255` - Defines the RGB color of the light emitted by the projectile.
*   `radius`: `150` - The radius of the light effect.

## Particle Emitters

The projectile utilizes multiple `ParticleEmitterComponent`s to generate various visual effects.

### Smoke Emitter

*   `emitted_material_name`: `smoke` - Emits smoke particles.
*   `count_min`, `count_max`: `5` - Number of smoke particles emitted.
*   `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max`: `0.1` to `0.3` - Duration of smoke particles.

### Spark Emitters (Multiple instances)

Several emitters are configured to produce `spark_purple_bright` particles, contributing to the projectile's trail and explosion effects. Key variations include:

*   **Trail Emitters:**
    *   `is_trail`: `1` - Indicates these are trail particles.
    *   `trail_gap`: `0.5` - Spacing between trail particles.
    *   `gravity.y`: Varies (`10`, `-10`, `0.0`) to control upward/downward/neutral drift.
    *   `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max`: Generally between `0.3` and `1.6`.
    *   `airflow_force`, `airflow_time`, `airflow_scale`: Influence particle movement in air.
    *   `fade_based_on_lifetime`: `1` or `0` - Controls how particles fade.
*   **Sparse Emitter:**
    *   `emission_interval_min_frames`, `emission_interval_max_frames`: `8` to `12` - Creates intermittent sparks.
    *   `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max`: `1.4` to `2.5`.
*   **Explosion/Burst Emitter:**
    *   `count_min`, `count_max`: `10` to `20` - Emits a burst of sparks.
    *   `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max`: `1.6` to `3.9`.
    *   `gravity.y`: `20` - Downward gravity for these sparks.

## Audio Component

*   `file`: `data/audio/Desktop/projectiles.bank` - The audio bank used.
*   `event_root`: `player_projectiles/bullet_rocket` - The root event for projectile sounds.

## Variable Storage Component
