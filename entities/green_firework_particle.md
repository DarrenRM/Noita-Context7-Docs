# Green Firework Particle

This entity defines a green firework effect, primarily composed of particle emitters. It's designed to create a visual spectacle rather than deal damage or interact physically.

## ProjectileComponent

This component governs the projectile's behavior. In this case, it's configured to not move, not explode on low velocity or collision, but *will* explode when its lifetime expires. It deals no damage.

| Attribute                 | Value | Description                                                                 |
