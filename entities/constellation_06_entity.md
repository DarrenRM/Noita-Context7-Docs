# Constellation 06 Entity

This entity defines a visual element for the game's introduction, specifically a constellation. It inherits its base properties from `constellation_base.xml` and customizes its visual appearance through a particle emitter.

## Key Components

### Base Entity

*   **file**: `data/entities/intro/constellation_base.xml`
    *   This attribute indicates that the entity inherits its fundamental properties and structure from the `constellation_base.xml` file.

### ParticleEmitterComponent

*   **image_animation_file**: `data/entities/intro/01_02.png`
    *   This specifies the image file used for the particle animation. This file likely contains a sequence of frames that create the visual effect of the constellation.
