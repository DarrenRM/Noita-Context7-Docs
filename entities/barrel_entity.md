# Barrel Entity

This document describes the properties of a barrel entity in Noita, focusing on its behavior when damaged and its physical characteristics.

## DamageModelComponent

This component governs how the entity reacts to damage.

### Key Attributes:

*   `hp`: The current health points of the barrel. (Default: `2`)
*   `max_hp`: The maximum health points the barrel can have. (Default: `2`)
*   `falling_damages`: Whether the entity takes damage from falling. (Default: `1` - enabled)
*   `falling_damage_min`, `falling_damage_max`: Minimum and maximum damage from falling based on height.
*   `fire_damage_amount`: The amount of damage taken from fire per tick. (Default: `0.2`)
*   `air_in_lungs`, `air_in_lungs_max`: Related to air mechanics, likely for entities that breathe. (Default: `5`)
*   `materials_that_damage`: Specifies materials that can damage this entity. (e.g., `acid`)
*   `materials_create_messages`: Specifies materials that, when interacting, create messages. (e.g., `meat`)

## ExplodeOnDamageComponent

This component defines the explosion behavior when the entity is damaged or destroyed.

### Key Attributes:

*   `explode_on_death_percent`: The percentage of HP remaining when the entity explodes upon death. (Default: `1` - explodes at 0% HP)
*   `explode_on_damage_percent`: The percentage of HP remaining when the entity explodes from regular damage. (Default: `0` - does not explode from regular damage)

### `config_explosion` Sub-attributes:

*   `damage`: The damage dealt by the explosion. (Default: `4`)
*   `damage_mortals`: Whether the explosion damages mortal entities. (Default: `1` - enabled)
*   `explosion_radius`: The radius of the explosion. (Default: `40`)
*   `create_cell_material`: The material created by the explosion cells. (Default: `fire`)
*   `create_cell_probability`: The probability of creating explosion cells. (Default: `50`)
*   `camera_shake`: The intensity of camera shake caused by the explosion. (Default: `40`)
*   `hole_enabled`: Whether the explosion creates holes in the environment. (Default: `1` - enabled)
*   `physics_explosion_power.max`: The maximum force of the physics-based explosion.
*   `sparks_enabled`: Whether sparks are generated by the explosion. (Default: `1` - enabled)
*   `stains_enabled`: Whether explosion stains are created. (Default: `1` - enabled)

## HitboxComponent

Defines the collision area of the entity.

### Key Attributes:

*   `aabb_min_x`, `aabb_max_x`, `aabb_min_y`, `aabb_max_y`: Defines the bounding box of the hitbox.
*   `is_enemy`, `is_item`, `is_player`: Flags to determine the entity's role in gameplay. (All `0` for barrel)

## MaterialInventoryComponent

This component manages the materials contained within the entity. For the barrel, it's configured to hold various materials, but all counts are set to `0` by default, meaning it doesn't inherently contain any specific material until interacted with or modified.

### Key Attributes:

*   `leak_on_damage_percent`: The percentage of HP loss that causes materials to leak out. (Default: `0.999` - leaks almost entirely on death)
*   `drop_as_item`: Whether the contents are dropped as an item upon destruction. (Default: `0` - disabled)

### `count_per_material_type`:

This section lists numerous material types. For this specific barrel entity, all `count` attributes are `0`, indicating it does not start with any of these materials.

## PhysicsBodyComponent

Defines the physical properties of the entity in the game world.

### Key Attributes:

*   `is_enabled`: Whether the physics body is active. (Default: `1` - enabled)
*   `allow_sleep`: Whether the body can enter a sleeping state to save performance. (Default: `1` - enabled)
*   `linear_damping`, `angular_damping`: Resistance to linear and angular motion. (Default: `0`)
*   `fixed_rotation`: Whether the body's rotation is fixed. (Default: `0` - not fixed)

## PhysicsImageShapeComponent

Defines the visual shape of the entity based on an image file, linked to its physics body.

### Key Attributes:

*   `image_file`: The path to the sprite used for the entity's visual representation. (Default: `data/items_gfx/barrel.png`)
*   `material`: The base material of the physics shape. (Default: `plastic`)
*   `centered`: Whether the image is centered on the physics body. (Default: `1` - enabled)
