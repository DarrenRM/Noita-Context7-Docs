# Beamstone Kick Particle

This entity defines the visual and explosive effects associated with the "Beamstone Kick" projectile in Noita. It primarily utilizes particle emitters to create visual flair and a projectile component to handle its lifetime and explosion.

## ProjectileComponent

This component governs the behavior of the projectile itself.

### Key Attributes:

*   `lifetime`: The duration in seconds before the projectile explodes.
    *   Value: `2`
*   `on_lifetime_out_explode`: Determines if the projectile explodes when its lifetime ends.
    *   Value: `1` (Explodes)
*   `damage`: The damage dealt by the projectile.
    *   Value: `0` (No direct damage)
*   `speed_min`, `speed_max`: The minimum and maximum speed of the projectile.
    *   Values: `0`, `0` (Implies it doesn't move on its own, likely spawned in place or attached)
*   `die_on_low_velocity`: Whether the projectile dies if its velocity drops too low.
    *   Value: `0` (Does not die)
*   `on_death_explode`: Whether the projectile explodes upon death (other than lifetime out).
    *   Value: `0` (Does not explode on death)
*   `on_death_gfx_leave_sprite`: Whether to leave a sprite graphic when it dies.
    *   Value: `0` (Does not leave a sprite)
*   `on_collision_die`: Whether the projectile dies upon collision.
    *   Value: `0` (Does not die on collision)

### config_explosion

This nested element defines the properties of the explosion that occurs when the projectile's lifetime ends.

#### Key Attributes:

*   `damage`: Damage dealt by the explosion.
    *   Value: `0` (No damage)
*   `camera_shake`: The intensity of camera shake during the explosion.
    *   Value: `30`
*   `explosion_radius`: The radius of the explosion effect.
    *   Value: `30`
*   `ray_energy`: The energy of any associated rays (often related to magical effects).
    *   Value: `60000`
*   `hole_destroy_liquid`: Whether the explosion destroys liquids.
    *   Value: `1` (Destroys liquid)
*   `hole_enabled`: Whether the explosion creates holes in terrain.
    *   Value: `1` (Creates holes)
*   `audio_event_name`: The sound effect played during the explosion.
    *   Value: `"explosions/holy"`
*   `never_cache`: Prevents caching of this explosion for performance.
    *   Value: `1`
*   `particle_effect`: Controls particle effects during explosion.
    *   Value: `0` (No specific particle effect from this setting)
*   `damage_mortals`: Whether the explosion damages living entities.
    *   Value: `0` (Does not damage mortals)
*   `physics_explosion_power.max`: Maximum power of physics-based explosions.
    *   Value: `0` (No physics explosion power)
*   `physics_throw_enabled`: Whether physics objects are thrown by the explosion.
    *   Value: `0` (Not enabled)
*   `shake_vegetation`: Whether the explosion shakes vegetation.
    *   Value: `0` (Not enabled)
*   `sparks_enabled`: Whether sparks are generated by the explosion.
    *   Value: `0` (Not enabled)
*   `stains_enabled`: Whether stains are left by the explosion.
    *   Value: `0` (Not enabled)

## ParticleEmitterComponent (x2)

This entity uses two identical `ParticleEmitterComponent` instances to generate visual particles. One emits green sparks, and the other emits white sparks.

### Key Attributes (for both emitters):

*   `emitted_material_name`: The name of the material used for the emitted particles.
    *   Values: `"spark_green"`, `"spark_white"`
*   `gravity.y`: The gravitational pull on the particles in the Y-axis.
    *   Value: `100.0`
*   `lifetime_min`, `lifetime_max`: The minimum and maximum lifetime of individual particles in seconds.
    *   Values: `0.5`, `1.5`
*   `count_min`, `count_max`: The minimum and maximum number of particles emitted per emission cycle.
    *   Values: `55`, `85`
*   `render_on_grid`: Whether particles are rendered on the game grid.
    *   Value: `1` (Rendered)
*   `fade_based_on_lifetime`: Whether particles fade out as their lifetime decreases.
    *   Value: `1` (Fades)
*   `area_circle_radius.max`: The maximum radius of the circular area from which particles are emitted.
    *   Value: `12`
*   `cosmetic_force_create`: Forces the creation of cosmetic particles.
    *   Value: `1`
*   `airflow_force`, `airflow_time`, `airflow_scale`: Parameters controlling airflow effects on particles.
    *   Values: `0.5`, `1.9`, `0.15`
*   `emission_interval_min_frames`, `emission_interval_max_frames`: The interval between particle emissions in frames.
    *   Values: `1`, `1` (Emits every frame)
*   `emit_cosmetic_particles`: Whether to emit cosmetic particles.
    *   Value: `1` (Emits cosmetic particles)
*   `collide_with_grid`: Whether particles collide with the game grid.
    *   Value: `0` (Does not collide)
*   `render_ultrabright`: Whether particles are rendered with ultrabrightness.
    *   Value: `0` (Not ultrabright)
*   `x_vel_min`, `x_vel_max`: Minimum and maximum velocity in the X-axis for emitted particles.
