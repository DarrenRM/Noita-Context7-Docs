# Tiny Yellow Poof Particle

This entity defines a small, yellow particle effect, often used for visual feedback like minor explosions or impacts. It primarily utilizes a `ProjectileComponent` for its lifetime and an `ParticleEmitterComponent` to generate the visual sparks.

## Key Components

### ProjectileComponent

This component governs the particle's behavior over time and its interaction with the environment.

| Attribute             | Value      | Description                                                                 |

| `on_death_explode`    | `0`        | The particle does not explode when it dies.                                 |
| `on_lifetime_out_explode` | `1`        | The particle will explode when its lifetime expires.                        |
| `on_collision_die`    | `0`        | The particle does not die upon collision.                                   |
| `damage`              | `0`        | The particle deals no damage.                                               |
| `lifetime`            | `2`        | The particle exists for a maximum of 2 seconds.                             |

#### config_explosion

This nested configuration defines the explosion that occurs when the `on_lifetime_out_explode` condition is met.

| Attribute             | Value      | Description                                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `damage`              | `0`        | The explosion deals no damage.                                              |
| `camera_shake`        | `0`        | No camera shake is applied.                                                 |
| `explosion_radius`    | `0`        | The explosion has no radius.                                                |

### ParticleEmitterComponent

This component is responsible for generating the visual sparks that make up the poof effect.
