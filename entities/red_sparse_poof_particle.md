# Red Sparse Poof Particle

This entity defines a particle effect that creates a sparse burst of red sparks. It's primarily used for visual feedback, such as when certain spells or effects occur.

## Key Components

### ProjectileComponent

This component defines the projectile-like behavior of the entity. In this case, it's configured to act as a temporary visual effect rather than a damaging projectile.

#### config_explosion

This nested configuration defines the "explosion" that occurs when the `ProjectileComponent`'s lifetime ends. It's set up to create more particles, not to cause damage or destruction.
