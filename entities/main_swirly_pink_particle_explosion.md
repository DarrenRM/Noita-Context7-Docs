# Main Swirly Pink Particle Explosion

This entity defines a specific particle explosion effect, characterized by swirly pink visual elements. It functions by loading other pre-defined particle entities to construct the overall effect.

## Key Components

The primary mechanism for creating this explosion is the `LoadEntitiesComponent`. This component is responsible for instantiating other entity files, effectively layering different particle effects to form the final visual.
