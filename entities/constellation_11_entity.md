# Constellation 11 Entity

This entity defines a visual element, likely a constellation or celestial pattern, used in the game's introduction. It inherits its base properties from `constellation_base.xml` and customizes its visual appearance through a particle emitter.

## Key Components

### Base Entity

*   **`file="data/entities/intro/constellation_base.xml"`**: Inherits core properties and behaviors from a base constellation entity. This is crucial for understanding its fundamental nature and potential interactions.

### Particle Emitter Component

*   **`image_animation_file="data/entities/intro/01_07.png"`**: Specifies the image file used for the particle animation. This file likely contains a sequence of frames that create the visual effect of the constellation.

## Usage

This entity is intended for use within the game's introductory sequences, contributing to the visual storytelling and atmosphere. Its specific placement and behavior would be determined by the game's level design and scripting.
