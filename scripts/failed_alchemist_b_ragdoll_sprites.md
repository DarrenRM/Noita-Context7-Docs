# Failed Alchemist (B) Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation describes the sprite assets used for the "Failed Alchemist (B)" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is defeated.

## Sprite Components

The ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite files, each representing a part of the alchemist's body or attire.

### Key Sprites

*   `head.png`: The sprite for the alchemist's head.
*   `torso.png`: The sprite for the alchemist's torso.
*   `cape1.png`: The sprite for the first layer of the alchemist's cape.
*   `cape2.png`: The sprite for the second layer of the alchemist's cape.
*   `tail1.png`: The sprite for the first segment of the alchemist's tail.
*   `tail2.png`: The sprite for the second segment of the alchemist's tail.

These sprites are typically used in conjunction with a ragdoll definition file (e.g., a `.xml` file) that specifies how these visual components are attached and behave in-game.
