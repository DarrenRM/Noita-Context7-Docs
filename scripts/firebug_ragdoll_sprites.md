# Firebug Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation describes the sprite assets used to construct the "Firebug" enemy's ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components that make up the character's body when it is defeated or dismembered.

## Sprite Components

The following image files are used to assemble the Firebug's ragdoll:

*   `head.png`: The sprite for the Firebug's head.
*   `torso.png`: The sprite for the Firebug's main body.
*   `foot1.png`: The sprite for one of the Firebug's feet.
*   `foot2.png`: The sprite for the other of the Firebug's feet.
*   `wing1.png`: The sprite for one of the Firebug's wings.
*   `wing2.png`: The sprite for the other of the Firebug's wings.

These individual sprites are likely combined and animated by the game's engine to create the ragdoll effect. The specific arrangement and physics applied to these sprites are handled in other game data files, not within this list of filenames.
