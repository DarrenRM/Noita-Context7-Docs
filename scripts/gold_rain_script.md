# Gold Rain Script

This script is responsible for spawning gold nuggets under specific conditions, primarily related to the player's vertical position. It dynamically determines the number and type of gold nuggets to spawn, with increased chances of rarer, more valuable nuggets appearing at greater depths.

## Key Functionality

*   **Dynamic Nugget Spawning:** Spawns gold nuggets based on random chance and player depth.
*   **Depth-Based Rarity:** The deeper the player is, the higher the probability of spawning more valuable gold nugget types.
*   **Surface Avoidance:** Attempts to spawn nuggets in locations not obstructed by surfaces.
*   **Screenshake:** Triggers a screenshake effect when gold is spawned.
