# Enlightened Alchemist Initialization

This script initializes the Enlightened Alchemist entity, defining its various elemental styles and their associated behaviors and visual effects.

## Core Functionality

The script dynamically assigns one of four elemental styles to the Enlightened Alchemist upon its creation. Each style modifies the entity's attack, damage properties, and visual appearance.

## Elemental Styles

The `styles` table defines the different elemental configurations. Each style has a `name` and a `setup` function that applies specific component modifications to the entity.
