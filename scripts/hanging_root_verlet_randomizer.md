# Hanging Root Verlet Randomizer

This script procedurally generates hanging root entities with randomized segments and physics properties. It's designed to create varied visual and physical behavior for root-like structures in Noita.

## Key Components

### VerletPhysicsComponent

This component governs the physics simulation of the hanging root.
