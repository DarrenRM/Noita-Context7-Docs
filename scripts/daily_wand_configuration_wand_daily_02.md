# Daily Wand Configuration (wand_daily_02)

This script configures a specific daily wand for Noita, leveraging the `generate_daily_wand` function.

## Wand Generation Parameters

The `generate_daily_wand` function is called with the following parameters:

*   **`40`**: Likely represents a base wand power or a similar numerical attribute.
*   **`2`**: Could indicate the number of spell slots or a related property.
*   **`false`**: A boolean flag, potentially controlling whether the wand is randomized or has specific fixed properties.

## Related Functions

This script relies on the `generate_daily_wand` function, which is defined in `data/scripts/gun/procedural/wand_daily.lua`. The commented-out `generate_gun` function suggests an alternative or older method for generating wands.
