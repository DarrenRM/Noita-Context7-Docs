# Chain to Ceiling Prop

This script creates a chain that hangs from the ceiling. It dynamically generates chain segments based on `VariableStorageComponent` values or defaults to a single chain.

## Core Functionality

The script attaches a series of physics-based chain segments to a nearby ceiling surface. It uses `VariableStorageComponent`s to define the number and offset of these chains.

## Key Components & Attributes

### `LuaComponent`

This is the primary component that executes the script.
