# Wand Unshuffle 10

This script defines a specific wand configuration for Noita, likely intended for procedural generation or as a pre-defined wand.

## Core Functionality

The `generate_gun` function is called with the following parameters:

*   **180**: This likely represents a base wand ID or a numerical identifier for this specific wand configuration.
*   **11**: This could be a seed for procedural generation, a difficulty modifier, or another parameter influencing the wand's properties.
*   **true**: This boolean value might enable or disable a specific feature, such as a particular type of spell casting or a visual effect.

## Key Attributes (Inferred)

Based on the limited code, the following attributes are likely influenced by this script:

*   **Wand ID**: The `180` parameter suggests a unique identifier for this wand.
*   **Procedural Seed/Modifier**: The `11` parameter hints at how the wand's spells or properties might be generated or modified.
*   **Feature Toggle**: The `true` parameter indicates a specific behavior or characteristic that is activated.

## Usage

This script is designed to be executed within the Noita game environment to create or define the "Wand Unshuffle 10" configuration. It relies on the `gun_procedural.lua` script for its generation logic.
