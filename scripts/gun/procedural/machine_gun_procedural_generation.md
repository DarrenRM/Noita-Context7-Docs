# Machine Gun Procedural Generation

This script defines the procedural generation logic for a "machine gun" type weapon in Noita. It focuses on creating weapons with a high rate of fire and a varied set of projectile actions.

## Key Attributes and Generation Logic

The script modifies several key attributes of the `AbilityComponent` to define the gun's behavior. The generation is heavily influenced by randomness, with a chance for rarer, more powerful variations.

### Core Gun Configuration

These are the primary settings that define the gun's firing mechanics.
