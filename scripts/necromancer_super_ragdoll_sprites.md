# Necromancer Super Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the "Necromancer Super" ragdoll in Noita, intended for AI-assisted modding.

## Sprite Components

The ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite files, each representing a part of the character's body and clothing. These are typically used in conjunction with physics and animation systems to create the ragdoll effect.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `head.png`: The sprite for the Necromancer Super's head.
*   `body.png`: The sprite for the Necromancer Super's torso.
*   `cape_1.png` to `cape_4.png`: A series of sprites representing the different layers or segments of the Necromancer Super's cape. These likely contribute to the cloth simulation and visual flow of the cape.
*   `r_arm_1.png` and `r_arm_2.png`: Sprites for the Necromancer Super's right arm, potentially indicating different poses or segments.
*   `l_arm_1.png` and `l_arm_2.png`: Sprites for the Necromancer Super's left arm, similar to the right arm.

These sprite files are crucial for defining the visual appearance of the Necromancer Super when it is in a ragdoll state. Modders can potentially swap or modify these sprites to alter the appearance of this enemy.
