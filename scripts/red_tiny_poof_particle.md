# Red Tiny Poof Particle

This entity defines a small, red particle effect, often used for visual feedback like minor explosions or impacts. It primarily utilizes a `ProjectileComponent` for its lifetime and a `ParticleEmitterComponent` to generate the visual sparks.

## Key Components

### ProjectileComponent

This component governs the particle's behavior over time and its interaction with the environment.
