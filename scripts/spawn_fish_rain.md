# Spawn Fish Rain

This script creates a "rain" of fish entities falling from the sky. It's designed to be attached to an entity that triggers the effect, such as a spell or a specific building.

## Key Functionality

*   **Randomized Fish Count:** Spawns a random number of fish between 4 and 8.
*   **Randomized Fish Types:** Selects fish types from a predefined list (`fish_01`, `fish_02`).
*   **Randomized Placement:** Fish are spawned at random horizontal positions relative to the trigger entity and a fixed vertical offset below it.
*   **Randomized Flipping:** Each fish has a 50% chance of being flipped horizontally.
*   **Screenshake:** Triggers a screenshake effect upon execution.
