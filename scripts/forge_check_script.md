# Forge Check Script

This script, `forge_check.lua`, is a placeholder intended to prevent potential errors. Its current implementation is minimal and does not perform any active functions related to the game's forge mechanics.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this script is to exist as a valid Lua file within the `scripts/misc` directory. This prevents the game engine from throwing an error if it attempts to load a script from this location and finds none.

## Key Attributes

*   **Functionality:** None.
*   **Dependencies:** None.
*   **Configuration:** None.
*   **Usage:** Placeholder.

## Implementation Details

The script contains a single comment: `-- this doesn't do anything, just to stop an error from happening`. This clearly indicates its non-functional nature.

## AI Modding Considerations

For AI-assisted modding, this script can be safely ignored or removed if it's not part of a larger, functional mod. If a mod requires a script in this location, this file can be replaced with a more functional script that implements desired forge-related logic.
