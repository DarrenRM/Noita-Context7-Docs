# Ultimate Killer Ragdoll Assets

This documentation describes the image assets used to construct the "Ultimate Killer" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll's body parts.

## Key Assets

The following image files are essential for the Ultimate Killer ragdoll:

### Torso
- `torso.png`: The primary visual component for the ragdoll's torso.

### Legs
- `left_leg.png`: The visual component for the ragdoll's left leg.
- `right_leg.png`: The visual component for the ragdoll's right leg.

## Usage

These `.png` files are typically referenced by the game's entity or ragdoll system to assemble the visual representation of the "Ultimate Killer" when it is defeated or its physics are simulated. The game engine will use these sprites to create the segmented, physics-enabled body.
