# Failed Alchemist Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the "Failed Alchemist" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is defeated.

## Sprite Components

The ragdoll is composed of several distinct image files, each representing a part of the alchemist's body or equipment.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `head.png`: The head of the failed alchemist.
*   `torso1.png`: The primary torso segment.
*   `torso2.png`: A secondary torso segment, likely for layering or variation.
*   `thighs.png`: The leg portion from the thighs downwards.
*   `spike1.png` & `spike2.png`: These likely represent spiked elements, possibly from armor or weapons.
*   `foot1.png` & `foot2.png`: The left and right feet.
*   `arm1.png` & `arm2.png`: The left and right arms.
*   `hand1.png` & `hand2.png`: The left and right hands.

These sprites are typically used in conjunction with a `.xml` definition file that dictates how these pieces are assembled, their physics properties, and their behavior when the ragdoll is active.
