# Plague Rat Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the "Plague Rat" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll's body parts.

## Sprite Files

The following `.png` files are used to construct the Plague Rat ragdoll:

*   `head.png`: The sprite for the rat's head.
*   `torso_right.png`: The sprite for the right side of the rat's torso.
*   `torso_left.png`: The sprite for the left side of the rat's torso.
*   `tail_start.png`: The sprite for the beginning segment of the rat's tail.
*   `tail_end.png`: The sprite for the end segment of the rat's tail.

## Usage

These sprites are typically referenced within the game's entity or ragdoll definition files to assemble the visual representation of the Plague Rat when it is defeated or its physics simulation is active. The game engine will combine these individual sprite pieces to form the complete ragdoll.
