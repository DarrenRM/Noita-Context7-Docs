# Worm Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation describes the sprite assets used for the worm ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the worm's segmented body when it is in a ragdoll state.

## Sprite Files

The following PNG files represent individual segments of the worm's ragdoll. These are typically used in conjunction with animation or physics systems to create the ragdoll effect.

### Key Sprites

*   `worm_part_01.png`
*   `worm_part_02.png`
*   `worm_part_03.png`
*   `worm_part_04.png`

These sprites are likely arranged sequentially to form the full length of the worm's ragdoll. The specific order and how they are connected would be defined in the associated ragdoll configuration files (not provided in this source).
