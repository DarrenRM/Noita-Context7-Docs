# Enlightened Alchemist Ragdoll Assets

This documentation describes the image assets used for the "Enlightened Alchemist" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll's body parts.

## Key Components

The ragdoll is composed of several distinct image files, each representing a different body part.

### Head Assets
*   `head1.png`: Primary head texture.
*   `head2.png`: Secondary head texture, potentially for variations or damage states.

### Torso Assets
*   `torso1.png`: Primary torso texture.
*   `torso2.png`: Secondary torso texture.
*   `torso3.png`: Tertiary torso texture, suggesting multiple visual variations for the torso.

### Hand Assets
*   `hand1.png`: Primary hand texture.
*   `hand2.png`: Secondary hand texture.

### Tentacle Assets
*   `tent1.png`: Primary tentacle texture.
*   `tent2.png`: Secondary tentacle texture. These likely represent the unique appendages of the Enlightened Alchemist.

## File Structure
