# Torch Stand Ragdoll Filenames

This documentation outlines the filenames associated with the "torch_stand" ragdoll in Noita, as found in the `data/ragdolls/torch_stand/filenames.txt` file.

## Ragdoll Components

The `filenames.txt` file lists the individual sprite files that constitute the "torch_stand" ragdoll. These files are typically used to animate the ragdoll's movement and reactions within the game.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `out.png`: This is the primary sprite file for the torch stand ragdoll. It likely represents the default or a significant pose of the ragdoll.

## File Structure

The filenames are organized within the `data/ragdolls/torch_stand/` directory. This structure helps in managing and referencing the various visual assets for this specific ragdoll.

## AI Modding Considerations

For AI-assisted modding, understanding these filenames is crucial for:

*   **Asset Replacement:** Modders can replace `out.png` with custom sprites to alter the appearance of the torch stand.
*   **Animation Logic:** If the ragdoll has multiple frames or states, identifying all associated sprite files (though only `out.png` is listed here) would be necessary for manipulating animation sequences.
*   **Entity Behavior:** While not directly defined in this file, the ragdoll's visual representation is tied to its in-game behavior. Knowing the ragdoll's assets can inform how to modify its interactions or reactions.
