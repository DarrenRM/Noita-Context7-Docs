# Bloom Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite filenames used for the "Bloom" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll's appearance when it breaks apart.

## Sprite Files

The following `.png` files are used to construct the Bloom ragdoll:

*   `torso.png`: The main body segment of the ragdoll.
*   `flower.png`: A floral element associated with the ragdoll.
*   `tentacle_1.png` through `tentacle_6.png`: Various tentacle segments that form the ragdoll's appendages.

These sprites are located within the `data/ragdolls/bloom/` directory.
