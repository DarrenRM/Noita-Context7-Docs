# Shotgunner Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite filenames used for the Shotgunner enemy's ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the enemy when it is defeated and its body parts are scattered.

## Sprite Components

The Shotgunner ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite files, each representing a different body part or item.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `torso.png`: The main body of the shotgunner.
*   `head.png`: The head of the shotgunner.
*   `gun.png`: The shotgun held by the enemy.
*   `left_arm.png`: The left arm of the shotgunner.
*   `left_hand.png`: The hand of the left arm.
*   `left_thigh.png`: The left thigh of the shotgunner.
*   `left_foot.png`: The left foot of the shotgunner.
*   `right_thigh.png`: The right thigh of the shotgunner.
*   `right_foot.png`: The right foot of the shotgunner.

These sprites are typically loaded and positioned by the game engine to create the ragdoll effect upon the enemy's death. Modders can potentially replace these sprites to alter the appearance of the shotgunner's ragdoll.
