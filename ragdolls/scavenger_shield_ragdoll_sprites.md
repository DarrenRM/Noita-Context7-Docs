# Scavenger Shield Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the "Scavenger Shield" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is in a non-animated, physics-driven state.

## Sprite Files

The following PNG files represent individual body parts of the Scavenger Shield ragdoll. These are typically used in conjunction with a ragdoll definition file (e.g., `.xml`) to assemble the complete ragdoll.

### Key Sprites

*   `torso.png`: The main body segment of the ragdoll.
*   `thighs.png`: Represents the upper leg segments.
*   `head.png`: The head component of the ragdoll.
*   `left_foot.png`: The sprite for the left foot.
*   `right_foot.png`: The sprite for the right foot.
*   `hand.png`: Represents the hand component.

## Usage

These sprite files are referenced by ragdoll definition files, which specify how these visual components are attached and behave under physics simulation. They are crucial for creating distinct visual appearances for different enemy types or character states.

**Note:** The exact usage and integration of these sprites depend on the specific ragdoll definition file they are associated with.
