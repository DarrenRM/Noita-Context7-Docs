# Bat Ragdoll Sprite Definitions

This documentation outlines the sprite definitions for the "bat" ragdoll in Noita, as found in the `data/ragdolls/bat/filenames.txt` file. These files specify the individual image assets that constitute the bat's ragdoll.

## Key Sprite Components

The bat ragdoll is composed of several distinct image files, each representing a part of its body. These are typically used in conjunction with physics and animation systems to create the ragdoll effect.

### Sprite Files

*   `torso.png`: The primary sprite for the bat's body.
*   `wing1.png`: The sprite for the first wing.
*   `wing2.png`: The sprite for the second wing.

These sprites are essential for defining the visual appearance of the bat when it is in a ragdoll state. AI modding tools can leverage these definitions to understand how to manipulate or replace these visual components.
