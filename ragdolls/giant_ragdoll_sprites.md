# Giant Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite filenames used for the "giant" ragdoll entity in Noita. These files define the visual components of the giant's ragdoll when it is broken apart.

## Sprite Files

The following `.png` files represent individual parts of the giant's ragdoll. These are typically used in conjunction with animation and physics systems to create the ragdoll effect.

### Key Sprite Components

*   `body.png`: The main body segment of the giant.
*   `limb1.png` through `limb8.png`: Various limb segments that detach from the body. The numbering suggests a specific order or type of limb.
