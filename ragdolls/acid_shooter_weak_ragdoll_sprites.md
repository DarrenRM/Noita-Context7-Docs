# Acid Shooter Weak Ragdoll Sprites

This document details the sprite filenames used for the "Acid Shooter Weak" enemy's ragdoll. These files define the visual components of the enemy when it is defeated and its body breaks apart.

## Sprite Filenames

The following PNG files are used to construct the ragdoll animation for the Acid Shooter Weak.

*   `torso.png`
*   `tentacle_1_a.png`
*   `tentacle_1_b.png`
*   `tentacle_2_a.png`
*   `tentacle_2_b.png`
*   `tentacle_3_a.png`
*   `tentacle_3_b.png`
*   `tentacle_4_a.png`
*   `tentacle_4_b.png`

## Key Elements

*   **Torso:** Represents the main body of the enemy.
*   **Tentacles:** Multiple tentacle sprites are provided, likely with variations (`_a`, `_b`) to create different poses or animation frames for the ragdoll's limbs. The numbering (`1` through `4`) suggests distinct tentacle parts.

## Usage

These sprites are referenced within the game's data files to define how the Acid Shooter Weak's ragdoll is rendered. Modders can use this information to replace or modify these sprites to alter the appearance of the defeated enemy.
