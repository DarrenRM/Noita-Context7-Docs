# Alchemist Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation describes the sprite assets used for the Alchemist's ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the Alchemist when it is in a ragdoll state.

## Sprite Components

The Alchemist ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite images, each representing a different body part. These are typically used in conjunction with physics and animation systems to create the ragdoll effect.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `torso.png`: The main body sprite.
*   `head.png`: The sprite for the Alchemist's head.
*   `cowl.png`: The sprite for the Alchemist's cowl or hood.
*   `left_arm.png`: The sprite for the Alchemist's left arm.
*   `left_hand.png`: The sprite for the Alchemist's left hand.
*   `right_hand.png`: The sprite for the Alchemist's right hand.
*   `left_foot.png`: The sprite for the Alchemist's left foot.
*   `right_foot.png`: The sprite for the Alchemist's right foot.

These sprites are typically loaded and managed by the game's entity system and are referenced within entity definitions or specific ragdoll configurations.
