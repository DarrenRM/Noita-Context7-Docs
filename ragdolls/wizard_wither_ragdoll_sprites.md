# Wizard Wither Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the "Wizard Wither" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is in a non-animated, physics-driven state.

## Sprite Files

The following PNG files represent the individual body parts of the Wizard Wither ragdoll.

### Key Sprites

*   `torso.png`: The main body sprite.
*   `hand.png`: Sprite for the hand.
*   `feet.png`: Sprite for the feet.
*   `head.png`: Sprite for the head.

These sprites are typically used in conjunction with a ragdoll definition file (e.g., a `.xml` file) that specifies how these sprites are attached, their physics properties, and their behavior.
