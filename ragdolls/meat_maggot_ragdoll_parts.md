# Meat Maggot Ragdoll Parts

This documentation describes the image files that constitute the ragdoll for the "Meat Maggot" entity in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when the entity is damaged or dies.

## Ragdoll Image Files

The following files define the individual parts of the Meat Maggot's ragdoll. Each file represents a distinct visual segment that can be detached or animated.

### Key Files

*   `part_1.png`
*   `part_2.png`
*   `part_3.png`
*   `part_4.png`
*   `part_5.png`
*   `part_6.png`
*   `part_7.png`
*   `part_8.png`
*   `part_9.png`

These PNG files are expected to be located within the `data/ragdolls/meatmaggot/` directory. When the Meat Maggot entity is affected by physics or damage, these parts will be spawned and interact according to the game's ragdoll physics system.
