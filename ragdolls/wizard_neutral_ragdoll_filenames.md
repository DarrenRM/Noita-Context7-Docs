# Wizard Neutral Ragdoll Filenames

This documentation outlines the image filenames used for the "wizard_neutral" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the wizard's ragdoll.

## Key Components

The following image files are essential for constructing the wizard's neutral ragdoll:

*   `torso.png`: The main body segment of the wizard.
*   `hand.png`: The image for the wizard's hand.
*   `feet.png`: The image for the wizard's feet.
*   `head.png`: The image for the wizard's head.

## File Structure

These files are located within the `data/ragdolls/wizard_neutral/` directory.

## Usage

These `.png` files are referenced by the game's engine to render the ragdoll physics and animations for the neutral wizard character. They are typically used in conjunction with ragdoll definition files (e.g., `.xml` or `.lua`) that specify how these image components are connected and behave.
