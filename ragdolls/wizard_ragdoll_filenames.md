# Wizard Ragdoll Filenames

This documentation outlines the image filenames used for the wizard's ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the wizard's body when it is in a ragdoll state.

## Key Components

The following files define the individual parts of the wizard's ragdoll:

*   `torso.png`: The main body segment of the wizard.
*   `hand.png`: The wizard's hand.
*   `feet.png`: The wizard's feet.
*   `head.png`: The wizard's head.

These images are typically used in conjunction with physics and animation systems to create realistic ragdoll behavior.
