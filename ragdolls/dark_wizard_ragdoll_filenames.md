# Dark Wizard Ragdoll Filenames

This document outlines the filenames associated with the Dark Wizard's ragdoll components. These files define the visual assets used for the Dark Wizard's body parts when it is in a ragdoll state.

## Ragdoll Components

The following files represent the individual parts of the Dark Wizard's ragdoll:

*   `torso.png`: The main body segment of the ragdoll.
*   `hand.png`: The hand component of the ragdoll.
*   `feet.png`: The feet component of the ragdoll.
*   `head.png`: The head component of the ragdoll.

These PNG files are typically used in conjunction with animation and physics systems within Noita to create realistic or stylized ragdoll effects for the Dark Wizard entity.
