# Scavenger Grenade Ragdoll Assets

This documentation outlines the image assets used for the "Scavenger Grenade" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is destroyed or dismembered.

## Key Components

The ragdoll is composed of several distinct image files, each representing a part of the scavenger grenade's body or equipment.

### Image Files

| Filename        | Description        |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| `torso.png`     | The main body/core |
| `thighs.png`    | Leg segments       |
| `head.png`      | The head component |
| `gun.png`       | Attached weapon    |
| `left_foot.png` | Left foot          |
| `right_foot.png`| Right foot         |
| `arm.png`       | Arm component      |

These PNG files are used by the game engine to render the ragdoll's fragmented appearance. The specific arrangement and behavior of these parts are typically defined in associated `.xml` or `.lua` files not included in this asset list.
