# Fungus Giga Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the "Fungus Giga" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is in a non-animated, physics-driven state.

## Sprite Files

The following `.png` files are used to construct the Fungus Giga ragdoll. Each file represents a distinct part of the ragdoll's visual representation.

*   `stalk.png`: The main body or stalk of the fungus.
*   `cap.png`: The cap or head of the fungus.
*   `foot1.png`: The first foot segment.
*   `foot2.png`: The second foot segment.
*   `foot3.png`: The third foot segment.

These sprites are typically loaded and positioned by the game's ragdoll system to simulate the physics and appearance of the Fungus Giga when it is defeated or interacting with the environment in a ragdoll state.
