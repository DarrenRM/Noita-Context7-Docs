# Spider Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the spider's ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the spider when it is in a ragdoll state, typically upon death or significant impact.

## Sprite Components

The spider ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite files, each representing a part of its body. These are typically used in conjunction with a ragdoll physics system to animate the falling or twitching of the spider.

### Key Sprite Files

*   **torso.png**: The main body of the spider.
*   **head.png**: The spider's head.
*   **leg1.png** to **leg4.png**: The four primary legs of the spider.
*   **antenna_left1.png**, **antenna_left2.png**: Left-side antennae.
*   **antenna_right1.png**, **antenna_right2.png**: Right-side antennae.

## Usage

These `.png` files are referenced within Noita's data files, likely in entity definitions or ragdoll configurations, to assemble the visual representation of the spider's ragdoll. The specific arrangement and animation of these sprites are handled by the game's engine and associated scripts.

## File Location

These sprite files are located within the `data/ragdolls/spider/` directory.
