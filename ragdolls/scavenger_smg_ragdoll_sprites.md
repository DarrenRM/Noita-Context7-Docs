# Scavenger SMG Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite filenames used for the Scavenger SMG's ragdoll. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when the entity is defeated.

## Sprite Filenames

The following PNG files are used to construct the Scavenger SMG ragdoll:

*   `torso.png`
*   `thighs.png`
*   `head.png`
*   `gun.png`
*   `left_foot.png`
*   `right_foot.png`
*   `arm.png`

## Key Components

The listed filenames represent distinct parts of the Scavenger SMG that will animate and fall apart independently upon death. Understanding these components is crucial for:

*   **Visual Customization:** Replacing or modifying these sprites to alter the appearance of the ragdoll.
*   **Animation Control:** Potentially influencing how each part behaves during the ragdoll physics simulation.
*   **Modding Integration:** Ensuring new or modified sprites are correctly referenced and placed within the game's asset structure.

## Usage Notes

*   These files are located within the `data/ragdolls/scavenger_smg/` directory.
*   The `.png` format indicates these are image assets.
*   The naming convention suggests a direct mapping to body parts and the weapon.
