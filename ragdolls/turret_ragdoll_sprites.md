# Turret Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite files used for the "turret" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the turret when it breaks apart.

## Sprite Components

The turret ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite images, each representing a part of the turret.

### Key Sprites

*   `gun.png`: The main gun component of the turret.
*   `cord.png`: Likely represents a connecting cord or cable.
*   `base.png`: The primary base or body of the turret.
*   `foot1.png` to `foot4.png`: Individual sprites for the turret's feet, suggesting a multi-legged design.

These sprites are used by the game engine to animate the destruction and scattering of the turret entity.
