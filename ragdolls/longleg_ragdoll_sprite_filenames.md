# Longleg Ragdoll Sprite Filenames

This document outlines the sprite filenames used for the "longleg" ragdoll entity in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is in a non-animated state.

## Sprite Components

The following image files are used to construct the longleg ragdoll:

*   `head.png`: The sprite for the head of the ragdoll.
*   `leg1.png`: The sprite for the first leg segment.
*   `foot1.png`: The sprite for the first foot.
*   `leg2.png`: The sprite for the second leg segment.
*   `foot2.png`: The sprite for the second foot.
*   `leg3.png`: The sprite for the third leg segment.
*   `foot3.png`: The sprite for the third foot.

These individual sprite files are typically combined and positioned by the game engine to form the complete ragdoll appearance.
