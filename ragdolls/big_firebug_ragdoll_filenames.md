# Big Firebug Ragdoll Filenames

This document lists the filenames for the individual sprite components that make up the Big Firebug's ragdoll in Noita. These files are essential for defining the visual appearance and animation of the creature when it is in a ragdoll state.

## Sprite Components

The Big Firebug ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite parts, each corresponding to a specific body segment.

### Key Components

*   **head.png**: The sprite for the creature's head.
*   **torso.png**: The sprite for the creature's main body.
*   **foot1.png** to **foot4.png**: Sprites for the creature's four feet.
*   **wing1.png**, **wing2.png**: Sprites for the creature's two wings.

These individual PNG files are used by the game engine to assemble the ragdoll and animate its movement. The arrangement and physics applied to these components are defined in separate configuration files.
