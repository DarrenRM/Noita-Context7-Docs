# Tentacler Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the Tentacler enemy's ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the Tentacler when it is in a ragdoll state (e.g., after being defeated).

## Sprite Files

The following `.png` files are used to construct the Tentacler's ragdoll. Each file represents a distinct part of the ragdoll.

### Key Sprites

*   `head.png`: The sprite for the Tentacler's head.
*   `tent1.png`: The sprite for the first tentacle segment.
*   `tent2.png`: The sprite for the second tentacle segment.
*   `tent3.png`: The sprite for the third tentacle segment.
*   `tent4.png`: The sprite for the fourth tentacle segment.

These sprites are typically loaded and assembled by the game engine based on the entity's configuration, defining its physical appearance in a ragdoll state.
