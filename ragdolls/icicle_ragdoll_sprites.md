# Icicle Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation describes the sprite assets used for the "icicle" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the icicle when it breaks apart.

## Sprite Components

The icicle ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite images, each representing a part of the broken icicle.

### Key Sprites

*   `cap_top.png`: The topmost segment of the icicle.
*   `cap_bottom.png`: The bottommost segment of the icicle.
*   `torso.png`: The main body segment of the icicle.
*   `foot_1.png` to `foot_4.png`: Multiple variations of foot-like segments, likely for different breaking patterns or visual variety.

These sprites are used by the game engine to animate and display the ragdoll effect when an icicle entity is destroyed.
