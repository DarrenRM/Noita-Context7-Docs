# Shaman Ragdoll Filenames

This documentation outlines the image filenames used for the Shaman's ragdoll components in Noita. These files define the visual appearance of the Shaman when it is in a ragdoll state.

## Ragdoll Components

The Shaman ragdoll is composed of several distinct image files, each representing a part of its body.

### Key Components

*   **torso.png**: The main body of the Shaman.
*   **head.png**: The Shaman's head.
*   **hand.png**: Represents the Shaman's hands.
*   **lantern.png**: The lantern carried by the Shaman.
*   **leg_l.png**: The Shaman's left leg.
*   **leg_r.png**: The Shaman's right leg.
*   **tentacle_l.png**: The Shaman's left tentacle.
*   **tentacle_r.png**: The Shaman's right tentacle.

These filenames are crucial for modders who wish to alter the appearance of the Shaman's ragdoll or create custom ragdoll effects. They directly correspond to the visual assets loaded by the game engine for ragdoll physics.
