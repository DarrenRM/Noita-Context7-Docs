# Wizard Returner Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation describes the sprite assets used for the "Wizard Returner" ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is in a non-animated, physics-driven state.

## Sprite Files

The following `.png` files represent individual parts of the Wizard Returner's ragdoll. These are typically used in conjunction with a ragdoll definition file (e.g., `.xml`) to assemble the complete visual representation.

### Key Sprite Components

*   **`torso.png`**: The main body sprite.
*   **`hand.png`**: Sprite for the character's hand(s).
*   **`feet.png`**: Sprite for the character's feet.
*   **`head.png`**: Sprite for the character's head.

These sprites are essential for visually representing the Wizard Returner when it is no longer actively animated and is instead subject to physics.
