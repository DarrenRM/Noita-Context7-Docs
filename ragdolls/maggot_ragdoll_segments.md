# Maggot Ragdoll Segments

This documentation describes the image files used to construct the ragdoll animation for the "Maggot" entity in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll, allowing for its segmented movement and deformation.

## Key Components

The maggot ragdoll is composed of several distinct image segments, each representing a part of its body. These segments are likely animated and positioned relative to each other to simulate the creature's movement.

### Image Files

The following image files define the visual segments of the maggot ragdoll:

*   `segment_1.png`
*   `segment_2.png`
*   `segment_3.png`
*   `segment_4.png`
*   `segment_5.png`
*   `segment_6.png`

These PNG files are expected to be sprite sheets or individual frames that are assembled and animated by the game engine. The naming convention suggests a sequential order for these segments, likely representing the head to tail or vice-versa.
