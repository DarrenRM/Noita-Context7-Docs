# Ghoul Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the Ghoul's ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the Ghoul when it is in a ragdoll state.

## Sprite Components

The Ghoul ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite images, each representing a part of its body.

### Key Sprites

*   `head.png`: The sprite for the Ghoul's head.
*   `torso.png`: The sprite for the Ghoul's torso.
*   `left_whisker.png`: The sprite for the Ghoul's left whisker.
*   `right_whisker.png`: The sprite for the Ghoul's right whisker.
*   `left_foot.png`: The sprite for the Ghoul's left foot.
*   `right_foot.png`: The sprite for the Ghoul's right foot.

These sprites are typically used in conjunction with physics and animation systems to create the ragdoll effect. Modders can potentially replace or modify these sprites to alter the Ghoul's appearance in its ragdoll state.
