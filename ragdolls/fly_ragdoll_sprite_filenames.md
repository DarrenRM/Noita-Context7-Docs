# Fly Ragdoll Sprite Filenames

This document lists the filenames for the individual sprite components that make up the "fly" ragdoll in Noita. These files are used to define the visual appearance and animation of the fly entity when it is in a ragdoll state.

## Sprite Components

The fly ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite parts, each contributing to the overall visual representation.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `head.png`: The sprite for the fly's head.
*   `torso_right.png`: The sprite for the right side of the fly's torso.
*   `torso_left.png`: The sprite for the left side of the fly's torso.
*   `right_leg.png`: The sprite for the fly's right leg.
*   `left_leg.png`: The sprite for the fly's left leg.
*   `wing.png`: The sprite for the fly's wing.

These image files are typically referenced within the game's entity or ragdoll definition files to assemble the complete ragdoll.
