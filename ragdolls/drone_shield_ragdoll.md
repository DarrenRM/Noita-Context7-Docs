# Drone Shield Ragdoll

This documentation describes the ragdoll assets for the "drone_shield" entity in Noita.

## Filenames

This section lists the primary image files associated with the drone shield's ragdoll.

### Image Files

*   `drone.png`: The main sprite for the drone shield's ragdoll.

## Key Attributes (Conceptual)

While the provided data is minimal, ragdolls in Noita typically define the physical properties and visual representation of an entity when it's no longer actively controlled or is destroyed. For the drone shield, this would likely involve:

### Physics and Collision

*   **Collision Shape:** Defines the boundaries for physics interactions.
*   **Mass:** Affects how the ragdoll reacts to forces.
*   **Friction:** Determines how it interacts with surfaces.
*   **Bounciness:** Controls how much it rebounds upon impact.

### Visual Representation

*   **Sprite:** The image file (`drone.png`) used to render the ragdoll.
*   **Animation States:** Potentially different frames or states for the ragdoll's appearance (e.g., intact, broken).

### Behavior

*   **Gravity Influence:** How gravity affects the ragdoll's movement.
*   **Air Resistance:** How air slows down the ragdoll.
*   **Decay/Lifetime:** If the ragdoll has a limited lifespan after being created.
