# Goblin Bomb Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the Goblin Bomb ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the ragdoll when it is destroyed or interacts with physics.

## Sprite Components

The Goblin Bomb ragdoll is composed of several distinct sprite images, each representing a body part. These are typically used in conjunction with physics and animation systems to create the ragdoll effect.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `torso.png`: The main body sprite.
*   `head.png`: The head sprite.
*   `left_arm.png`: The left arm sprite.
*   `right_arm.png`: The right arm sprite.
*   `left_leg.png`: The left leg sprite.
*   `right_leg.png`: The right leg sprite.
*   `left_foot.png`: The left foot sprite.
*   `right_foot.png`: The right foot sprite.

These sprites are located within the `data/ragdolls/goblin_bomb/` directory. When a Goblin Bomb ragdoll is activated, these images are rendered and manipulated by the game's physics engine.
