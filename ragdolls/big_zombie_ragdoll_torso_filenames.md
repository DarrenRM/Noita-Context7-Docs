# Big Zombie Ragdoll Torso Filenames

This document outlines the image filenames used for the "big zombie" ragdoll's torso and its associated body parts. These files are crucial for defining the visual appearance and structure of the ragdoll in Noita.

## Key Components

The following filenames represent the individual sprite components that make up the big zombie's ragdoll. These are typically used in conjunction with a configuration file that defines their positioning and behavior.

### Torso and Limbs

*   `torso.png`: The main body segment of the big zombie.
*   `right_thigh.png`: The upper part of the right leg.
*   `right_foot.png`: The foot of the right leg.
*   `right_arm.png`: The upper part of the right arm.
*   `right_hand.png`: The hand of the right arm.
*   `left_thigh.png`: The upper part of the left leg.
*   `left_foot.png`: The foot of the left leg.
*   `left_arm.png`: The upper part of the left arm.
*   `tail.png`: The tail segment of the big zombie.

These image files are expected to be located within the `data/ragdolls/bigzombie/` directory. When combined and animated, they form the visual representation of the big zombie's ragdoll physics.
