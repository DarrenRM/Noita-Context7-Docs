# Pebble Ragdoll Configuration

This documentation outlines the configuration for the "pebble" ragdoll in Noita, focusing on its visual components.

## Ragdoll Components

The pebble ragdoll is defined by its visual assets, primarily image files that represent different parts of the ragdoll.

### Filenames

The `filenames.txt` file lists the image files used for the pebble ragdoll.

```
data/ragdolls/pebble/torso.png
```

### Key Attributes

*   **`torso.png`**: This is the primary image file defining the visual appearance of the pebble's torso. It dictates the shape and texture of the ragdoll's main body.

## AI Modding Considerations

When modding the pebble ragdoll, developers should focus on:

*   **Visual Consistency**: Ensuring any new or modified assets align with the existing visual style of the pebble.
*   **Performance**: Large or complex image files can impact performance. Optimize assets where possible.
*   **Animation Compatibility**: While not explicitly detailed here, the image files are expected to be compatible with Noita's ragdoll animation system.
