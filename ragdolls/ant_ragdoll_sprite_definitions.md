# Ant Ragdoll Sprite Definitions

This documentation outlines the sprite definitions for the "ant" ragdoll in Noita, crucial for AI-assisted modding of character appearances and animations.

## Sprite Components

The ant ragdoll is composed of individual sprite files, each representing a distinct body part. These are typically used to construct the visual representation of the ant entity.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `head.png`: The head of the ant.
*   `upper_torso.png`: The upper section of the ant's body.
*   `lower_torso.png`: The lower section of the ant's body.
*   `left_hind_leg.png`: The left rear leg.
*   `right_hind_leg.png`: The right rear leg.
*   `left_front_leg.png`: The left front leg.
*   `right_front_leg.png`: The right front leg.
*   `antenna_left.png`: The left antenna.
*   `antenna_right.png`: The right antenna.
*   `left_arm.png`: The left arm.
*   `left_hand.png`: The left hand.
*   `right_arm.png`: The right arm.
*   `right_hand.png`: The right hand.

## Usage in Modding

These sprite definitions are fundamental for:

*   **Customizing Ant Appearance:** Replacing existing sprites with custom artwork.
*   **Creating New Ant Variants:** Assembling new ragdolls using these or modified sprite components.
*   **Animation Development:** Understanding the structure of the ragdoll is the first step in creating or modifying animations that utilize these sprites.

**Note:** The exact positioning and layering of these sprites are determined by the entity's configuration and animation scripts, which are not detailed in this file.
