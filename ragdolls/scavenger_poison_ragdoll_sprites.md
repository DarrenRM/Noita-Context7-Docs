# Scavenger Poison Ragdoll Sprites

This documentation outlines the sprite assets used for the "Scavenger Poison" enemy's ragdoll in Noita. These files define the visual components of the enemy when it is defeated and its body breaks apart.

## Sprite Components

The following image files represent the individual parts of the Scavenger Poison's ragdoll. These are typically used in conjunction with animation and physics to create the ragdoll effect.

### Key Sprite Files

*   `torso_upper.png`: The upper section of the scavenger's torso.
*   `torso_lower.png`: The lower section of the scavenger's torso.
*   `left_thigh.png`: The left thigh bone and associated sprite.
*   `right_thigh.png`: The right thigh bone and associated sprite.
*   `head.png`: The head of the scavenger.
*   `gun.png`: The weapon carried by the scavenger.
*   `left_foot.png`: The left foot of the scavenger.
*   `right_foot.png`: The right foot of the scavenger.
*   `arm.png`: A generic arm sprite, likely used for both left and right arms.
*   `hand.png`: A generic hand sprite, likely used for both left and right hands.

These sprites are crucial for visually representing the dismemberment and physics-driven collapse of the Scavenger Poison enemy upon defeat. Modders can use these as a reference for creating custom ragdolls or modifying existing ones.
