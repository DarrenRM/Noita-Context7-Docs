# c7075024d92dee360b5cc05ca573f99c

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their properties within Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different game elements, such as AI behaviors, physics properties, and item attributes. This schema is crucial for the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize data associated with entities, allowing for the creation of diverse and complex gameplay mechanics.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema file.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `PhysicsComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `gravity`, `hp`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, as well as more complex types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (string), `struct LensValue<float>`, and `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`.

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Var>` elements nested within their respective `<Component>` elements.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's data is organized around distinct components, each responsible for a specific aspect of an entity's behavior or properties.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each variable within a component is explicitly defined with its name, size, and type, providing a clear contract for how data should be structured.
*   **Data Type Variety:** The schema supports a range of data types, from simple primitives to complex custom structures and classes, allowing for detailed configuration of game elements.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are generally descriptive, indicating their purpose (e.g., `min_distance`, `gravity`, `item_pickup_radius`).
*   **String Representation:** Strings are often represented using a C++-like type signature, suggesting the underlying implementation.
*   **Vector Types:** `ceng::math::CVector2<float>` and `ceng::math::CVector2<int>` are used for 2D vector data.
*   **Lens Values:** `struct LensValue<float>` appears to be a custom type for float values, possibly with additional metadata or functionality.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This sample shows variables related to an AI's attack capabilities. It defines parameters like the probability of using an attack, attack range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), the name of the attack animation, and the entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks.

**2. `PhysicsComponent` Variables (implied by context):**

```xml
    <Var name="mass" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="gravity" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="fly_time_max" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="flying_needs_recharge" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet illustrates physics-related properties. It includes `mass`, `gravity`, a maximum flight time (`fly_time_max`), and a boolean flag indicating if flying requires recharging. The `struct LensValue<float>` suggests a more complex way of handling float values for flight time.

**3. `ItemComponent` Variables (implied by context):**

```xml
    <Var name="play_pick_sound" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="spawn_pos" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="ui_description" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="is_pickable" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="hp" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
```

This sample highlights properties of items. It includes whether to play a sound when picked up, a spawn position (`spawn_pos`), a UI description, a flag for pickability, and the item's health points (`hp`).
