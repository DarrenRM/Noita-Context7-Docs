# 2cecb49c3deb55479828707601aac254

This XML file defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint or template for how different game entities (like enemies, items, or environmental objects) are structured and what properties they can possess. By defining these components and their associated variables, the game engine knows how to load, interpret, and manage the data for each element, enabling complex behaviors and interactions. This file is crucial for understanding the underlying data structures that drive the game's mechanics.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>` for transformations, `enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum` for enumerations).

The structure is hierarchical, with the root `<Schema>` element containing all `<Component>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game objects are composed of various independent components, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality (e.g., AI, audio, physics, item properties).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, specifying their names, data types, and sizes. This allows for granular control over the properties of each component.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`), string types (represented by `class std::basic_string`), complex structures (`struct ceng::math::CXForm`), and enumerations (`enum`).
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`, `item_pickup_radius`).
*   **String Representation:** String data types are consistently represented by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, indicating they are standard C++ strings.

## Sample Entries

**1. AIAttackComponent:**
This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.
```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables controlling attack range, timing, animation, projectile spawning, and aiming mechanics.

**2. AudioComponent:**
This component defines parameters for audio playback associated with an entity.
```xml
  <Component component_name="AudioComponent" >
    <Var name="file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="event_root" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="set_latest_event_position" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="play_only_if_visible" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This demonstrates how sound files, event triggers, and playback conditions are managed.

**3. ItemCostComponent:**
This component defines the cost and stealability of an item.
```xml
  <Component component_name="ItemCostComponent" >
    <Var name="cost" size="8" type="__int64" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="stealable" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows how economic properties of items are defined, including their base cost and whether they can be stolen.
