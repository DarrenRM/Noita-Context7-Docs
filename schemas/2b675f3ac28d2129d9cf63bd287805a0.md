# 2b675f3ac28d2129d9cf63bd287805a0

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. These components dictate the behavior, attributes, and functionalities of entities within the game world, such as enemies, items, and environmental elements. By defining these components, the game can systematically create and manage the diverse interactions and characteristics of its objects. This file acts as a blueprint for how different game elements are configured.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute that identifies it.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable.
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are empty, indicating that their values are defined elsewhere or are set dynamically by the game engine.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component is described by a list of its constituent variables, specifying their names, sizes, and data types.
*   **Data Types**: Common data types like integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings (`class std::basic_string<...>`) are used.
*   **AI and Physics Focus**: The sampled sections highlight components related to Artificial Intelligence (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and physics (`PhysicsThrowableComponent`), suggesting a significant portion of the file is dedicated to defining entity behavior and physical interactions.
*   **Damage and Fire Mechanics**: Components like `FireComponent` and `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent` indicate definitions for damage dealing and elemental effects.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`**:
This component defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="28" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="28" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This section defines variables like `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `max_distance`, `angular_range_deg` for attack targeting, `state_duration_frames` for attack timing, and `animation_name` for visual feedback. It also includes specific parameters for ranged attacks, such as the entity file to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_file`) and the number of entities to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_count_min`, `attack_ranged_entity_count_max`).

**2. `AIComponent` (partial sample)**:
This component appears to be a more general AI controller.

```xml
    <Var name="pixel_gravity" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="swim_idle_buoyancy_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_to_play" size="28" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="run_animation_velocity_switching_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```
This snippet shows variables related to environmental interaction (`pixel_gravity`, `swim_idle_buoyancy_coeff`) and animation control (`animation_to_play`, `run_animation_velocity_switching_enabled`), indicating how entities might react to physics and display animations.

**3. `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent`**:
This component defines how an entity can damage other entities within a certain radius.

```xml
  <Component component_name="DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="time_between_damaging" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_description" size="28" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="target_tag" size="28" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component defines the `radius` of effect, the minimum and maximum `damage` values, the `time_between_damaging` to prevent overwhelming damage, a `damage_description` string, and a `target_tag` to specify which entities are affected.
