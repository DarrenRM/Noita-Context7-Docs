# df216a900104d0e078fcfe8efdf56d88

This XML file, identified by the hash `df216a900104d0e078fcfe8efdf56d88`, defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within the game Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different aspects of game entities, such as their AI behaviors, physical properties, visual representations, and scripting hooks. This schema file is crucial for the game's engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data associated with each component, enabling the creation of diverse enemies, items, and environmental interactions.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct functional unit within the game. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies its purpose. Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define the individual properties or variables associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can range from primitive types like `int`, `float`, and `bool` to more complex types like `enum` and C++ class types (e.g., `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` for 2D vectors).

The structure is hierarchical: the root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements, and each `<Component>` contains multiple `<Var>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game utilizes a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file defines the structure of these components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's behavior and properties are defined by its variables, which are meticulously described with their names, sizes, and data types.
*   **String Representation:** String data, often used for file paths, animation names, or script names, is consistently represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Vector Representation:** 2D vector data, likely for positions or directions, is represented by `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`.
*   **Enum Types:** Enumerated types are used for variables with a fixed set of possible values, indicated by `enum TYPE_NAME::Enum`.
*   **Scripting Hooks:** Many components include variables that are strings, suggesting they are used to reference specific Lua scripts that are executed when certain events occur (e.g., `script_death`, `script_wand_fired`).

## Sample Entries

### AIAttackComponent

This component appears to define the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="frames_between" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="frames_between_global" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables controlling attack range, timing, animations, and the projectile entity to be used in ranged attacks.

### AreaDamageComponent

This component defines an area that deals damage over time.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AreaDamageComponent" >
    <Var name="aabb_min" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_max" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_type" size="4" type="enum DAMAGE_TYPES::Enum" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_per_frame" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="update_every_n_frame" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="death_cause" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="entities_with_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample illustrates how an area of effect can be defined by its bounding box (`aabb_min`, `aabb_max`), the type and amount of damage it inflicts, its update frequency, and which entities it affects.

### ScriptComponent

This component seems to be a central hub for defining script execution based on various in-game events.

```xml
    <Var name="script_inhaled_material" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_death" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_throw_item" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_material_area_checker_failed" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_material_area_checker_success" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_wand_fired" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_teleported" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
This sample shows a variety of `script_` prefixed variables, each pointing to a string that likely represents the filename or identifier of a Lua script to be executed upon specific game events like death, throwing an item, or a wand being fired.
