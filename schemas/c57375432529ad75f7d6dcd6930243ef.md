# c57375432529ad75f7d6dcd6930243ef

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. These components are the building blocks for entities, dictating their behavior, appearance, and interactions. This schema file acts as a blueprint, specifying the types and names of variables that each component can possess, allowing the game engine to correctly load and interpret entity data. Understanding this file is crucial for anyone looking to deeply analyze or modify Noita's game mechanics.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema.
*   **`<Component>`:** Each component is defined within its own `<Component>` tag.
    *   **`component_name` attribute:** This attribute specifies the unique name of the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AreaDamageComponent`).
    *   **`<Var>`:** Inside each `<Component>`, `<Var>` tags define the individual properties or variables that the component can have.
        *   **`name` attribute:** The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `damage_per_frame`).
        *   **`size` attribute:** Indicates the memory size allocated for this variable.
        *   **`type` attribute:** Specifies the data type of the variable. This can range from primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool` to more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` (a 2D vector of floats).

The overall pattern is a hierarchical definition of components and their constituent variables.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly demonstrates Noita's use of a component-based entity system, where entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Variable Typing:** A wide range of data types are used, from simple numerical and boolean values to complex string and vector types, allowing for detailed configuration of component behavior.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Component and variable names are generally descriptive, providing clues about their purpose (e.g., `AIAttackComponent` suggests AI-driven attacks, `AreaDamageComponent` implies damage over an area).
*   **String Representation:** C++ standard library string types are frequently used for names, file paths, and other textual data.
*   **Vector Types:** `CVector2<float>` is used for representing 2D positions, offsets, and other spatial data.
*   **Enum Types:** Some variables, like `damage_type`, are indicated as `enum` types, suggesting they draw from a predefined set of values.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines parameters for an AI's attacking behavior, including probabilities, distances, animation names, the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks, and whether aiming rotation is enabled.

2.  **`AreaDamageComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AreaDamageComponent" >
      <Var name="aabb_min" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="aabb_max" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_type" size="4" type="enum DAMAGE_TYPES::Enum" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_per_frame" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="entities_with_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines how an entity deals damage over a specific area. It includes bounding box limits (`aabb_min`, `aabb_max`), the type and amount of damage, and a way to specify which entities are affected based on their tags.

3.  **`MagicXRayComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="MagicXRayComponent" >
      <Var name="radius" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="steps_per_frame" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mRadius" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component likely governs a "magic x-ray" effect, defining its radius and how many steps it takes per frame to update its effect. The repetition of `radius` and `mRadius` might indicate different scopes or uses of the radius property.
