# f8ad2cb601b27706b26117a308eb3ae2

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables that configure different aspects of game entities, behaviors, and mechanics. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load and interpret the data associated with each component, influencing everything from enemy AI and physics to visual effects and player interactions.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a root `<Schema>` element, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute to identify it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property associated with that component.

The `<Var>` elements have the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` for 2D vectors).

The structure follows a pattern of:
```xml
<Schema ...>
  <Component component_name="ComponentName">
    <Var name="variable_name" size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    <Var name="another_variable" size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="AnotherComponentName">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly demonstrates Noita's use of a component-based system, where distinct functionalities are encapsulated into reusable components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each `<Var>` tag defines a specific parameter that can be configured for a component. This allows for fine-grained control over game mechanics.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types like integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and booleans (`bool`), as well as more complex C++ types like strings and vector classes.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are generally descriptive, indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `max_distance`, `acceleration`, `is_predator`).
*   **AI and Behavior:** Several components appear to define AI behaviors, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`, with variables related to attack ranges, targeting, and creature needs.
*   **Physics and Movement:** Components like `GasBubbleComponent` and elements within other components (e.g., `velocity`, `speed`, `max_throw_speed`) suggest definitions related to physics and movement.
*   **Visuals and Effects:** Components like `PixelSceneComponent` indicate how visual elements and scenes are defined.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. Variables like `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `max_distance`, and `angular_range_deg` control when and how an AI can attack, while `state_duration_frames` likely governs the duration of attack animations or states.

2.  **`AIComponent` (partial):**
    ```xml
    <Var name="hide_from_prey" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="hide_from_prey_target_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="food_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="defecates_and_pees" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This snippet from `AIComponent` reveals aspects of creature behavior. `hide_from_prey` and `hide_from_prey_target_distance` suggest stealth mechanics, while `food_material` and `defecates_and_pees` point to biological needs and actions.

3.  **`GenomeDataComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="GenomeDataComponent" >
      <Var name="herd_id" size="12" type="struct LensValue<int>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_predator" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="food_chain_rank" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component seems to define inherent biological or genetic properties of entities. `is_predator` and `food_chain_rank` are clear indicators of ecological roles, while `herd_id` might be used for grouping or social behaviors.
