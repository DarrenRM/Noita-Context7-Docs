# 4cfd0e7e09ae8827e6cdc8d9f91b4466

This XML file defines the data structures and properties for various game components in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the types and sizes of data associated with different game mechanics and entities. This is crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and manage the vast amount of data that defines the game's world, characters, items, and behaviors. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is organized.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct functional part of the game. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual data fields.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a single variable or data field within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`).
    *   `size`: The size of the data in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The structure is hierarchical: the schema contains components, and components contain variables.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's functionality is broken down into modular components, each with its own set of configurable variables. This allows for a flexible and organized data management system.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each `<Var>` tag clearly specifies the name, size, and type of data it holds. This is essential for the game engine to correctly read and write these values.
*   **String Representation:** String data types are represented by a verbose C++-like class name (`class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`), indicating the underlying implementation.
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are booleans (`type="bool"`) and are often used to enable or disable specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_enabled`, `materials_damage`).
*   **Numerical Properties:** A significant number of variables are numerical (`int` or `float`) and define quantities, thresholds, durations, or probabilities.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This section defines parameters for an AI's attack behavior. It includes how likely an attack is to be used (`use_probability`), the range at which it can be performed (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), and the name of the animation associated with the attack (`animation_name`).

2.  **`AIComponent` Variables (related to damage and environment):**
    ```xml
    <Var name="falling_damage_damage_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="air_needed" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="materials_damage" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="materials_that_damage" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This snippet from the `AIComponent` shows variables related to environmental interactions and damage. It defines maximum falling damage, whether air is required for survival (`air_needed`), and parameters for how certain materials can cause damage (`materials_damage`, `materials_that_damage`).

3.  **`PhysicsBodyComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="is_external" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="linear_damping" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_damping" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="allow_sleep" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This section from the `PhysicsBodyComponent` details physical properties of game objects. It includes whether the body is considered "external" (`is_external`), how it resists linear and angular motion (`linear_damping`, `angular_damping`), and whether it can enter a sleep state to save resources (`allow_sleep`).
