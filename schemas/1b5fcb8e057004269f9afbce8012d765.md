# 1b5fcb8e057004269f9afbce8012d765

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their properties within Noita. It acts as a blueprint or template for how different game entities, such as enemies, items, and environmental elements, are structured and configured. By defining these components and their associated variables, the game engine knows how to load, interpret, and utilize these elements to create the game world, its mechanics, and its behaviors. This schema file is crucial for understanding the underlying data structure of Noita's game objects.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains a `hash` attribute. Inside the `<Schema>` element, there are multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are empty, indicating that their values are defined elsewhere, likely in other data files that reference these schemas.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly demonstrates a component-based design. Game entities are likely composed of various components, each responsible for a specific aspect of their behavior or properties.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, detailing its configurable parameters. These variables cover a wide range of game mechanics, from AI behavior and combat to item properties and movement capabilities.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings (represented by `class std::basic_string<...>`).
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive and often indicate their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`, `is_melee_weapon`).
*   **String Representation:** String types are represented by a verbose C++-like type name, suggesting the underlying game engine's implementation.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component appears to define the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_shooting_ok_angle_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This section defines variables related to attack range, timing, animations, and projectile spawning for AI entities.

**2. `ItemActionComponent` (partial):**
This component seems to describe actions that items can perform.

```xml
  <Component component_name="ItemActionComponent" >
    <Var name="action_id" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_melee_weapon" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_self_healing" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_weapon" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_known" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_safe" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_consumed" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="never_use" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="ranged_min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This snippet shows boolean flags indicating item properties like being a melee weapon, healing, or being consumable, along with a minimum range for ranged actions.

**3. Movement-related variables (within an unshown component):**
This sample highlights variables related to movement capabilities.

```xml
    <Var name="frames_between_searches" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="y_walking_compensation" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="can_fly" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="can_walk" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="can_jump" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="can_dive" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="can_swim_on_surface" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="never_consider_line_of_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="space_required" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_jump_distance_from_camera" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="jump_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="initial_jump_lob" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
```
These variables define an entity's movement abilities, such as whether it can fly, walk, jump, dive, or swim, along with parameters for jump mechanics.
