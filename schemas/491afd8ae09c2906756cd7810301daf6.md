# 491afd8ae09c2906756cd7810301daf6

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data fields and their types for different game entities and systems. These components are fundamental building blocks that dictate the behavior, appearance, and interactions of everything from enemies and spells to environmental elements and player abilities. By defining these components in a structured format, Noita can efficiently load and manage game data, allowing for complex emergent gameplay.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema file.
*   **`<Component>`:** Each component is defined within its own `<Component>` tag.
    *   **`component_name` attribute:** This attribute specifies the name of the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `AltarComponent`).
    *   **`<Var>`:** Inside each `<Component>`, individual variables or properties are defined using `<Var>` tags.
        *   **`name` attribute:** The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `recognized_entity_tags`).
        *   **`size` attribute:** Indicates the memory size allocated for this variable.
        *   **`type` attribute:** Specifies the data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` for 2D vectors).
        *   The `<Var>` tag can be empty, indicating that the variable's value is stored elsewhere or managed by the game engine.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where distinct functionalities are encapsulated into named components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a series of `<Var>` tags, detailing its configurable parameters.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`), string representations (`class std::basic_string...`), and custom vector types (`class ceng::math::CVector2...`).
*   **AI and Behavior:** Many components appear to be related to Artificial Intelligence (`AIComponent`, `AIAttackComponent`, `AdvancedFishAIComponent`, `AnimalAIComponent`), defining movement, attack patterns, and decision-making.
*   **Physical Properties:** Components like `PhysicsBodyCollisionDamageComponent` and `PhysicsBodyComponent` suggest definitions related to physics, collision, and damage.
*   **Item and Inventory:** Components like the one sampled from lines 2926-2976 hint at item properties, including equipability, spawn positions, UI elements, and inventory management.
*   **Environmental Interactions:** Components like `AltarComponent` suggest definitions for interactive environmental objects.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` (from the first 100 lines):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), accuracy (`angular_range_deg`), animation triggers (`animation_name`), and details about ranged attacks, such as the projectile entity file (`attack_ranged_entity_file`) and whether aiming rotation is enabled (`attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled`).

**2. `AltarComponent` (from lines 263-313):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AltarComponent" >
    <Var name="recognized_entity_tags" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="good_fx_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="uses_remaining" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component describes an altar. It specifies which entity tags the altar recognizes (`recognized_entity_tags`), the material used for positive visual effects (`good_fx_material`), and how many uses the altar has remaining (`uses_remaining`).

**3. Item/Inventory Related Component (from lines 2926-2976):**

```xml
    <Var name="is_equipable_forced" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="play_pick_sound" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="spawn_pos" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="ui_sprite" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="ui_description" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="preferred_inventory" size="4" type="enum INVENTORY_KIND::Enum" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet, likely part of a component defining items or collectibles, includes properties like whether an item is forced to be equipped (`is_equipable_forced`), if picking it up should play a sound (`play_pick_sound`), its spawn position (`spawn_pos`), its UI sprite and description (`ui_sprite`, `ui_description`), and its preferred inventory slot (`preferred_inventory`).
