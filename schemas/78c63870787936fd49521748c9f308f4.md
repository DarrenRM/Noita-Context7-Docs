# 78c63870787936fd49521748c9f308f4

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different aspects of game entities, such as AI behavior, physics, and visual elements. By defining these schemas, Noita can consistently load and interpret game data, ensuring that entities behave as intended and that their properties are correctly represented. This file is crucial for understanding how game mechanics are implemented at a fundamental level and is a key resource for modders looking to alter or extend game functionality.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a root `<Schema>` element, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute to identify it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The structure is hierarchical:
```xml
<Schema>
  <Component component_name="ComponentName">
    <Var name="variable_name" size="byte_size" type="data_type">
      <!-- Optional content, often empty for basic types -->
    </Var>
    <!-- More Var elements -->
  </Component>
  <!-- More Component elements -->
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities (AI, physics, visual effects) are encapsulated within distinct components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, each with a specific name, size, and data type. This allows for granular control over the properties of game entities.
*   **String Representation:** String types are represented by a verbose C++-like type: `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`. This indicates the underlying data structure used for strings.
*   **Numerical Types:** Common numerical types like `int` (integer) and `float` (floating-point number) are used extensively for parameters like probabilities, distances, durations, and accelerations.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors, such as `attack_ranged_enabled` or `image_animation_loop`.
*   **Categorization by Component:** The components themselves suggest logical groupings of game mechanics. For example, `AIAttackComponent` deals with offensive AI behaviors, while `AIComponent` likely handles general AI logic, and `PathFindingComponent` is for navigation.

## Sample Entries

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This sample shows how an entity's attack can be configured with probabilities, ranges, animation names, and specific projectile entity files. The presence of `attack_ranged_use_laser_sight` indicates specific targeting mechanics.

2.  **`AIComponent` (partial sample)**: This component appears to define general AI movement and control parameters.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
      <Var name="fly_smooth_y" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="accel_x" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="accel_x_air" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="pixel_gravity" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mouse_look" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="keyboard_look" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This snippet reveals how AI entities might control their movement, including acceleration in different states (ground vs. air), gravity influence, and whether they can use mouse or keyboard input for aiming.

3.  **`LooseGroundComponent`**: This component seems to define properties for destructible or breakable ground elements.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="LooseGroundComponent" >
      <Var name="probability" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_durability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_angle" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_radius" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_radius" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="chunk_probability" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows that ground elements can have a probability of existing, a durability value, and parameters that define how they break apart (e.g., distance, angle, radius of chunks).
