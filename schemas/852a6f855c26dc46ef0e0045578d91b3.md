# 852a6f855c26dc46ef0e0045578d91b3

This XML file defines the structure and data types for various game components and their associated variables within the game Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining how different game entities' properties are organized and what kind of data they hold. This is crucial for the game's engine to correctly load, interpret, and utilize the data for entities, behaviors, and game mechanics. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is structured.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component (e.g., AI behavior, visual effects, physics properties).

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties associated with that component. Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The identifier for the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `damage_type`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the data type.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. This can be primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, or more complex types like `enum` and C++ class strings (e.g., `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`).

The structure is hierarchical: `Schema` -> `Component` -> `Var`.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The game appears to use a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file defines the properties of these components.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component's properties are defined by `<Var>` tags, specifying their name, size, and type.
*   **Data Types**: A variety of data types are used, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and enumerations (`enum`). String types are represented by C++ standard string class names.
*   **AI and Behavior Components**: Several components seem to relate to Artificial Intelligence and entity behavior, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`, defining parameters for movement, aggression, and attack patterns.
*   **Scripting Hooks**: Components like `ScriptComponent` define variables that likely hold names of scripts to be executed on specific game events (e.g., `script_wand_fired`, `script_death`).
*   **Debug Components**: There are components prefixed with `Debug`, suggesting they are used for development and debugging purposes (e.g., `DebugFollowMouseComponent`, `DebugLogMessagesComponent`).
*   **Damage and Effects**: Components related to damage and effects are present, indicated by variables like `damage_type`, `damage_description`, and `ragdoll_fx`.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet shows variables within the `AIAttackComponent`. It defines parameters for an AI's attack behavior, such as the probability of using an attack (`use_probability`), the range of the attack (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), the animation associated with the attack (`animation_name`), and the entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks (`attack_ranged_entity_file`). The `size="4"` for `int` and `float` is typical for 32-bit values, while `size="24"` for strings suggests a fixed buffer size.

**2. `AIComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="aggressiveness_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="aggressiveness_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="tries_to_ranged_attack_friends" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_melee_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```

This shows variables within the general `AIComponent`. It defines the minimum and maximum aggressiveness of an AI (`aggressiveness_min`, `aggressiveness_max`), whether it will attack allies with ranged attacks (`tries_to_ranged_attack_friends`), and if melee attacks are enabled (`attack_melee_enabled`). The `size="1"` for `bool` is standard.

**3. `DamageComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="time_between_damaging" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="damage_type" size="4" type="enum DAMAGE_TYPES::Enum" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="damage_description" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="target_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet from a `DamageComponent` (inferred from context, though the component tag itself isn't fully shown in the sample) defines how damage is applied. `time_between_damaging` controls the cooldown, `damage_type` specifies the elemental or physical type of damage, `damage_description` might be a string for UI or logging, and `target_tag` likely defines what kind of entities this damage component affects.

**4. `ScriptComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="script_wand_fired" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="script_teleported" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

These variables from a `ScriptComponent` indicate that specific string values (likely script filenames or identifiers) can be assigned to trigger actions when certain events occur, such as a wand being fired (`script_wand_fired`) or an entity teleporting (`script_teleported`).
