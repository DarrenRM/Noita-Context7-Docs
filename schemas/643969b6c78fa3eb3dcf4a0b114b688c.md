# 643969b6c78fa3eb3dcf4a0b114b688c

This XML file defines the schema for various components used within the game Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different game elements, such as AI behaviors, physics properties, visual components, and more. These schemas are crucial for the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data associated with entities, allowing for the creation of complex game mechanics and behaviors. Essentially, this file dictates how various game objects are configured and how they interact.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a root `<Schema>` element, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and is identified by a `component_name` attribute.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable.
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum` for enumerations).

The `<Var>` elements can be empty, indicating that the variable's value is defined elsewhere or is implicitly handled by the game engine.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The file clearly follows a component-based design, where game entities are composed of various independent components, each responsible for a specific aspect of their behavior or appearance.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This provides a structured way to manage game data.
*   **String Representation**: String data types are represented by a complex class name, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, indicating they are standard C++ strings.
*   **Enums**: Enumerated types are used for properties that have a predefined set of possible values, such as `type` in `PhysicsJoint2Component`.
*   **Data Types**: A variety of fundamental data types are used, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings. More complex types like `ceng::math::CVector2<float>` are also present, suggesting vector math capabilities.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component defines parameters for an AI's attack behavior. It includes variables for attack probability, range, duration, animation names, and details about ranged attacks like the entity file to spawn and the count of entities.

**2. `HitboxComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="HitboxComponent" >
    <Var name="is_player" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_enemy" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_item" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_min_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_max_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_min_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_max_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_multiplier" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component defines the physical hitbox of an entity. It specifies whether the hitbox belongs to a player, enemy, or item, its bounding box coordinates (`aabb_min_x`, `aabb_max_x`, etc.), and a damage multiplier.

**3. `PhysicsJoint2Component`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="PhysicsJoint2Component" >
    <Var name="joint_id" size="2" type="unsigned short" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="break_force" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="break_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="type" size="4" type="enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="body1_id" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component describes a physics joint, likely used for connecting rigid bodies. It includes properties like a joint ID, forces and distances at which the joint breaks, the type of joint, and identifiers for the bodies it connects.
