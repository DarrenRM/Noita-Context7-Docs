# c277bce2369dfa56a12e9f430471139a

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within the game Noita. It acts as a blueprint for how different game entities (like enemies, items, or environmental elements) are structured and configured. By defining these components and their properties, the game engine knows how to load, interpret, and utilize these elements to create the game world, its behaviors, and its interactions. This file is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanics and for modding the game, as it dictates the available parameters for customization.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains a `hash` attribute. Inside the `<Schema>` element, the primary organizational unit is the `<Component>` tag. Each `<Component>` tag represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute that identifies it (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `CrawlerAnimalComponent`).

Within each `<Component>`, individual properties or variables are defined using the `<Var>` tag. The `<Var>` tag has several key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `ray_length`, `length`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, or more complex types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` (representing a 2D vector of floats).

The structure is hierarchical: `<Schema>` contains `<Component>`s, and `<Component>`s contain `<Var>`s.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The file clearly demonstrates a component-based design. Each `<Component>` tag encapsulates a specific set of functionalities or properties that can be attached to game entities.
*   **Variable Definitions**: The `<Var>` tag is consistently used to define the parameters for each component. The `type` attribute is crucial for understanding how to interpret the data associated with each variable.
*   **String Representation**: C++ standard library string types are frequently used, indicated by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`. These typically represent file paths or descriptive names.
*   **Vector Types**: For positional or directional data, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` is used, indicating 2D vectors composed of floating-point numbers.
*   **Boolean Flags**: `bool` types are used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors.
*   **Numerical Parameters**: `int` and `float` types are used for numerical values such as probabilities, distances, speeds, durations, and counts.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This section defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities. Variables like `use_probability` and `min_distance`/`max_distance` control when and how an attack is initiated. `animation_name` likely specifies the animation to play during an attack, and `attack_ranged_entity_file` points to the game asset (e.g., a projectile) used for ranged attacks.

**2. `CrawlerAnimalComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="CrawlerAnimalComponent" >

    <Var name="ray_length" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="ray_count" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="give_up_area_radius" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
```

This component seems to define the behavior of crawling creatures. `ray_length` and `ray_count` might be used for pathfinding or obstacle detection. `speed` controls their movement speed, and `give_up_area_radius` could define a zone where the creature stops pursuing a target.

**3. `IKLimbWalkerComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="IKLimbWalkerComponent" >

    <Var name="ground_attachment_min_spread" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="ground_attachment_max_tries" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="leg_velocity_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="affect_flying" size="1" type="bool" >
```

This component appears to be related to inverse kinematics (IK) for walking limbs. Variables like `ground_attachment_min_spread` and `ground_attachment_max_tries` suggest how the component attempts to place its "feet" on the ground. `leg_velocity_coeff` likely influences the speed and responsiveness of the leg movement, and `affect_flying` determines if this component's logic applies to entities in the air.
