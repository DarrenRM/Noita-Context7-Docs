# 4e5fd697aaa2417a1e6383a8a8c5dd4c

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within the game Noita. It acts as a blueprint for how different game entities, such as creatures, objects, and spells, are structured and configured. By defining these components and their properties, the game engine can correctly load, interpret, and manage the behavior and attributes of these elements. This schema file is crucial for understanding the underlying data structures that govern gameplay mechanics, AI, physics, and more.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>` which contains a `hash` attribute. Inside the `<Schema>` element, there are multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties associated with that component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`, `enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum`).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, indicating that their values are defined elsewhere or are determined at runtime.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly follows a component-based design, where functionality is broken down into reusable components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `GhostComponent`, `PhysicsJointComponent`).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, detailing its configurable properties.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`), string types (represented by `class std::basic_string`), vector types (e.g., `ceng::math::CVector2<float>`), and enumerated types (`enum`).
*   **AI and Behavior:** Many components appear to relate to Artificial Intelligence and creature behavior, with variables for detection ranges, aggressiveness, attack parameters, and movement.
*   **Physics and Mechanics:** Components like `PhysicsJointComponent` suggest definitions for physical interactions and constraints.
*   **String Representation:** String types are represented using a verbose C++ class name, indicating the underlying implementation.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. AIAttackComponent:**
This component appears to define the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
This sample shows variables related to attack probabilities, ranges, and specific attack animations or projectile entities.

**2. AIComponent:**
This component seems to be a general AI controller, defining broader behavioral aspects.

```xml
<Component component_name="AIComponent" >
  <Var name="creature_detection_range_x" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="creature_detection_range_y" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="creature_detection_angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="aggressiveness_min" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="aggressiveness_max" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_melee_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
This snippet illustrates variables for how AI entities perceive their environment, their general aggressiveness, and whether melee attacks are enabled.

**3. GhostComponent:**
This component likely defines the behavior and properties of "ghost" entities in the game.

```xml
<Component component_name="GhostComponent" >
  <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="velocity" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="aggressiveness" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="target_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
This shows variables for movement speed, velocity, aggressiveness, and a target tag, suggesting how ghosts might hunt or interact with specific entities.

**4. PhysicsJointComponent:**
This component defines properties for physics joints, which are used to connect rigid bodies.

```xml
<Component component_name="PhysicsJointComponent" >
  <Var name="nail_to_wall" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="breakable" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="type" size="4" type="enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="pos_x" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="pos_y" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
This sample includes variables for whether a joint can be nailed to a wall, if it's breakable, its type, and its position.
