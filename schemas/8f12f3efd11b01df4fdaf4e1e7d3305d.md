# 8f12f3efd11b01df4fdaf4e1e7d3305d

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within the game Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different game elements, such as AI behaviors, physical properties, and visual effects. This schema file is crucial for the game's engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data associated with entities and their functionalities. By defining these components and their properties, the game can manage complex interactions and behaviors of in-game objects.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Within each component, `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `struct LensValue<float>`, `enum ARC_TYPE::Enum`, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`).

The structure is hierarchical, with the root `<Schema>` element containing multiple `<Component>` elements, and each `<Component>` containing multiple `<Var>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated within distinct components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ArcComponent`, `AreaDamageComponent`).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, detailing its configurable parameters.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** The `type` attribute of `<Var>` elements is quite specific, indicating not only basic types like `int` and `float` but also complex C++ types like `std::basic_string` (for strings) and custom structs/classes like `LensValue` and `CVector2`. This suggests a direct mapping to the game's underlying C++ code.
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are of type `bool`, often prefixed with "use\_", "is\_", or "allow\_", indicating flags that enable or disable specific behaviors or properties.
*   **Numerical Parameters:** A significant number of variables are `int` or `float`, used for numerical values such as distances, durations, speeds, probabilities, and sizes.
*   **String Parameters:** Variables of type `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` are used for string values, likely for names of animations, entity files, or messages.
*   **Vector Types:** `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` indicates the use of 2D vectors for properties like positions or extents.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.
```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows how an AI's attack can be configured with probabilities, distances, angular constraints, animation names, and the specific entity file to be used for ranged attacks.

**2. `ArcComponent`:**
This component appears to define properties for arc-shaped visual or functional elements.
```xml
  <Component component_name="ArcComponent" >
    <Var name="type" size="4" type="enum ARC_TYPE::Enum" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="lifetime" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
It includes a `type` (likely an enumeration for different arc styles), a `material` identifier, and a `lifetime` in frames.

**3. `AreaDamageComponent`:**
This component defines how an area can inflict damage.
```xml
  <Component component_name="AreaDamageComponent" >
    <Var name="aabb_min" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_max" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="circle_radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
It uses `CVector2` for defining the minimum and maximum extents of an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) and a `circle_radius` for circular damage areas.

**4. `PhysicsComponent` (implied by variables):**
While not explicitly shown as a full component in the samples, variables like `allow_sleep`, `fixed_rotation`, `buoyancy`, `gravity_scale_if_has_no_image_shapes`, `is_bullet`, `is_static`, `is_kinematic`, `is_character`, `go_through_sand`, `gridworld_box2d`, `auto_clean`, and `on_death_leave_physics_body` strongly suggest the presence of a `PhysicsComponent` that governs an entity's physical properties and interactions within the game world.
