# 732f2003ff9bb2d5abc9e5b38fab4ed2

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within the game Noita. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the structure and data types for different game mechanics, entities, and behaviors. By defining these components and their properties, the game engine knows how to interpret and utilize data related to AI, physics, visual effects, and more. This schema file is crucial for understanding how game elements are configured and how they interact.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. These components are identified by a `component_name` attribute. Within each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `struct ValueRange`, `struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>`, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`).

The `type` attribute often indicates complex data structures or string types, suggesting that the game uses C++ internally.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where functionality is broken down into modular components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This allows for granular control over component behavior.
*   **Data Type Variety:** A range of data types are used, from primitive types like `int`, `float`, and `bool` to more complex types like strings (`class std::basic_string...`), vectors (`class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`), and transformations (`struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>`).
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`, `emitter_lifetime_frames`).
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are booleans (`size="1" type="bool"`), used to enable or disable specific features or behaviors within a component.
*   **Numerical Parameters:** Numerous variables are integers (`int`) or floating-point numbers (`float`), used for numerical values like speeds, distances, durations, and probabilities.
*   **String Identifiers:** String types are used for names, file paths, or other textual identifiers (e.g., `animation_name`, `attack_ranged_entity_file`, `parent_hotspot_tag`).

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. AIAttackComponent:**
This component appears to define parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" > </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" > </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" > </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" > </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" > </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" > </Var>
</Component>
```
This snippet shows variables controlling attack probability, range, targeting angles, the animation to play during an attack, and the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks.

**2. CrawlerAnimalComponent:**
This component seems to define parameters for creatures that crawl or move along surfaces.

```xml
<Component component_name="CrawlerAnimalComponent" >
  <Var name="ray_length" size="4" type="float" > </Var>
  <Var name="ray_count" size="4" type="int" > </Var>
  <Var name="gravity" size="4" type="float" > </Var>
  <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" > </Var>
  <Var name="give_up_time" size="4" type="int" > </Var>
</Component>
```
Here, variables define how the crawler senses its environment (ray length and count), its physical properties (gravity), its movement speed, and how long it will persist before giving up.

**3. InheritTransformComponent:**
This component likely handles the inheritance of transformations (position, rotation, scale) from a parent entity.

```xml
<Component component_name="InheritTransformComponent" >
  <Var name="use_root_parent" size="1" type="bool" > </Var>
  <Var name="only_position" size="1" type="bool" > </Var>
  <Var name="parent_hotspot_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" > </Var>
  <Var name="Transform" size="32" type="struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>" > </Var>
</Component>
```
This shows boolean flags to control inheritance behavior, a string to identify a specific parent attachment point, and a complex type for the transformation matrix itself.
