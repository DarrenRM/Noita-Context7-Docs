# dc44e6d126b82b67766396c9cc21ff09

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the types of data and their attributes that can be associated with different game entities. These components likely govern the behavior, appearance, and interactions of everything from enemies and spells to environmental elements and player abilities. By defining these components, the game can systematically load and manage the vast array of game objects and their characteristics.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains all the `<Component>` definitions.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies the type of component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AudioLoopComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables that belong to that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their purpose is to define the structure and type, not to hold specific values.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game logic and data are broken down into modular components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** The primary content within each component is the definition of its variables using the `<Var>` tag.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** The `type` attribute in `<Var>` is crucial, indicating how the data for that variable should be interpreted (e.g., as a whole number, a decimal, a boolean flag, or text).
*   **String Representation:** String types are represented by a verbose C++-like type name, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Boolean Representation:** Boolean values are indicated by `type="bool"` and a `size="1"`.
*   **Numerical Representation:** Integers and floats are represented with `type="int"` and `type="float"` respectively, typically with `size="4"`.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component appears to define parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows variables like `use_probability` (likely how often the AI attacks), `min_distance` and `max_distance` (range of the attack), `angular_range_deg` (the cone of fire), `animation_name` (the animation to play during attack), and `attack_ranged_entity_file` (the projectile or entity spawned by a ranged attack).

**2. `AudioLoopComponent`:**
This component defines properties for looping audio effects.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AudioLoopComponent" >
    <Var name="file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="event_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="auto_play" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="volume_autofade_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
Here, `file` would specify the audio file, `event_name` might be an identifier for sound events, `auto_play` is a boolean to control if the sound starts automatically, and `volume_autofade_speed` controls how quickly the volume fades.

**3. `ItemAlchemyComponent`:**
This component seems to be related to the alchemy system, defining how materials are transformed.

```xml
  <Component component_name="ItemAlchemyComponent" >
    <Var name="material_make_always_cast" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="material_remove_shuffle" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="material_animate_wand" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
Variables like `material_make_always_cast`, `material_remove_shuffle`, and `material_animate_wand` suggest parameters that control the behavior of alchemical reactions, potentially related to casting spells, shuffling materials, or animating wands.
