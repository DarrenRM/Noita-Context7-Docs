# c17cd5f577034747544a5e1bc90464b7

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data fields and their types for different game entities and systems. This is crucial for the game engine to understand how to load, interpret, and utilize these components, influencing everything from enemy AI behavior to visual effects and player abilities.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables or properties associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The structure is hierarchical, with the root element being `<Schema>` which contains all the `<Component>` definitions.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components. This allows for modularity and reusability of game logic.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, specifying its configurable parameters.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings. The string type is represented by a C++ standard library string class.
*   **AI and Behavior:** Several components appear to be related to Artificial Intelligence (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`), defining parameters for enemy behavior, attacks, and reactions.
*   **Visual and Effect Components:** Components like `EnergyShieldComponent` and `ExplodeOnDamageComponent` suggest definitions for visual effects, damage handling, and entity transformations.
*   **Game State and Properties:** Components like `EndingMcGuffinComponent` and variables within other components hint at game state management, item properties, and entity characteristics.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables like `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `max_distance`, and `angular_range_deg` which control how and when an attack is performed. It also includes parameters for ranged attacks, such as the `attack_ranged_entity_file` (likely the projectile or effect spawned) and its count.

**2. `AIComponent` (partial sample):**
This component seems to be a more general AI controller, with variables related to entity state and behavior.

```xml
    <Var name="ragdollify_disintegrate_nonroot" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="wait_for_kill_flag_on_death" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="kill_now" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="drop_items_on_death" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="in_liquid_shooting_electrify_prob" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="fire_probability_of_ignition" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
```
This snippet reveals boolean flags for death behavior (`ragdollify_disintegrate_nonroot`, `drop_items_on_death`) and environmental interactions like `in_liquid_shooting_electrify_prob` and `fire_probability_of_ignition`.

**3. `EnergyShieldComponent`:**
This component defines the properties of an energy shield.

```xml
  <Component component_name="EnergyShieldComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_multiplier" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_energy" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="recharge_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="energy" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component clearly defines parameters like `radius`, `max_energy`, and `recharge_speed`, which are essential for managing the shield's effectiveness and behavior.
