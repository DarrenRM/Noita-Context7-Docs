# fe10410adddbcd182c4cf141c154bd80

This XML file, identified by the hash `fe10410adddbcd182c4cf141c154bd80`, defines the structure and properties of various game components and entities within Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint, dictating how different game elements are configured and behave. This file is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanics of entities, their attributes, and how they interact within the game world. It is likely used by the game engine to load and instantiate these components for various game objects, from enemies and items to environmental elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. These components are then further defined by `<Var>` elements, which specify individual properties or variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema file.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `HitboxComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `is_player`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The structure is hierarchical: the schema contains components, and components contain variables.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game appears to use a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file defines the available components and their configurable parameters.
*   **AI and Behavior:** Components like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` suggest a sophisticated AI system for entities, controlling their actions, movement, and combat behaviors.
*   **Physical Properties:** Components such as `HitboxComponent` define the physical boundaries and properties of entities, including their collision detection and damage modifiers.
*   **Scripting Integration:** Components like the one sampled from lines 3362-3412, which contain numerous `script_` prefixed variables, indicate a strong integration with scripting, allowing for custom behaviors and event handling. These variables likely store the names of Lua scripts to be executed on specific game events.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings (`class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`).
*   **Configuration Parameters:** The variables within each component represent configurable parameters that can be adjusted to fine-tune the behavior and characteristics of game entities.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` (from first 100 lines):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability, range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), targeting angles (`angular_range_deg`), the animation to play during an attack (`animation_name`), and the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks (`attack_ranged_entity_file`).

**2. `HitboxComponent` (from lines 2400-2450):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="HitboxComponent" >
    <Var name="is_player" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_enemy" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_item" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_min_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_max_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_min_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="aabb_max_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_multiplier" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines the physical hitbox of an entity. It specifies whether the entity is a player, enemy, or item, its bounding box coordinates (`aabb_min_x`, `aabb_max_x`, `aabb_min_y`, `aabb_max_y`), and a `damage_multiplier` which likely affects how much damage it deals or receives.

**3. Scripting Component (from lines 3362-3412):**

```xml
    <Var name="remove_after_executed" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="enable_coroutines" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_damage_received" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_item_picked_up" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="script_shot" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet shows variables related to script execution. `remove_after_executed` and `enable_coroutines` control script behavior. The `script_` prefixed variables (e.g., `script_damage_received`, `script_item_picked_up`, `script_shot`) are strings that likely hold the names of Lua scripts to be triggered when specific game events occur, allowing for highly customizable entity behavior.
