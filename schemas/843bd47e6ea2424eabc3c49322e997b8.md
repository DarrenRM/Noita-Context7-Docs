# 843bd47e6ea2424eabc3c49322e997b8

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types, sizes, and names of variables that make up different game entities and systems. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and manage game data, including entity behaviors, visual properties, and gameplay mechanics. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is organized and what parameters can be adjusted for different elements in the game.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct set of properties or a functional module within the game.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual data fields. Each `<Var>` has the following key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The identifier for the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `ragdoll_offset_y`, `radius`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the underlying data type.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>` (a 2D vector of integers).

The overall structure is a hierarchical definition of components and their constituent variables.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The game appears to use a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. Each `<Component>` tag in this schema defines the variables associated with a specific component.
*   **Variable Definitions**: The `<Var>` tags consistently define the name, size, and type of data. This allows for precise control over memory layout and data interpretation.
*   **String Representation**: C++ string types are represented using a verbose class name, like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`. This indicates the underlying C++ implementation.
*   **Vector Types**: 2D vectors are represented by types like `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>`, suggesting a custom math library is in use.
*   **Enums**: Some variables, like `ragdoll_fx_forced`, use an `enum` type, indicating a set of predefined named constants.
*   **Boolean Flags**: Variables with `type="bool"` are used for simple on/off states.
*   **Numerical Data**: `int` and `float` types are used for numerical values, ranging from probabilities and distances to durations and speeds.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability, range, angular targeting, animation names, and the entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks.

2.  **`AIComponent` (partial sample)**:
    ```xml
    <Var name="ragdoll_offset_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="blood_material" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="create_ragdoll" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This snippet from the `AIComponent` shows properties related to how an entity behaves when defeated. It includes offset for ragdoll physics, the material used for blood, and a boolean flag to determine if a ragdoll should be created.

3.  **`InventoryComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="InventoryComponent" >
      <Var name="ui_container_type" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="ui_container_size" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<int>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="ui_element_size" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<int>" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines properties for the game's inventory system, specifically related to its user interface. It includes variables for the type of UI container, its size, and the size of individual UI elements within the inventory.
