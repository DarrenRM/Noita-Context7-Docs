# 13668d41cf4fc670a2d706f9a31a21fc

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint, outlining the data fields and their types for different game entities and systems. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data associated with these components, influencing everything from enemy AI behavior to the properties of magical wands and environmental interactions.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a root `<Schema>` element containing multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct game component and has a `component_name` attribute that identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property associated with that component.

The `<Var>` elements have the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, or complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, or `class ConfigGun` for custom configurations).

Some `<Var>` elements may contain nested structures or be empty if they are placeholders or represent complex types that are defined elsewhere.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `PhysicsAIComponent`).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying the name, size, and data type. This allows for granular control over game object attributes.
*   **Data Types:** A mix of fundamental C++ data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex, game-specific types (indicated by `class ...`) are used. The string type is represented by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **AI Components:** A significant portion of the schema appears to be dedicated to defining AI behaviors, with components like `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, and `PhysicsAIComponent` detailing parameters for movement, targeting, and combat.
*   **Configuration Objects:** The presence of types like `class ConfigGun` and `class ConfigGunActionInfo` suggests that complex configurations for items like wands are managed through these structured data types.
*   **Environmental Interactions:** Components like `ElectricitySourceComponent` and `EnergyShieldComponent` indicate definitions for environmental effects and defensive mechanisms.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows how an AI's attack range, probability, and the specific projectile or entity it uses for ranged attacks are defined.

**2. `AIComponent` (partial):**
This component seems to be a more general AI controller.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    <Var name="drop_as_item_on_death" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="ui_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="use_gun_script" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="gun_config" size="20" type="class ConfigGun" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This snippet illustrates properties like whether an entity drops loot on death, its display name, and if it utilizes a gun script with associated configuration.

**3. `PathFindingGridMarkerComponent`:**
This component likely relates to how entities navigate the game world.

```xml
  <Component component_name="PathFindingGridMarkerComponent" >
    <Var name="marker_work_flag" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="marker_offset_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="marker_offset_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="player_marker_radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows parameters for marking positions or areas within the pathfinding grid, potentially for AI movement or target acquisition.
