# 2bd033356f2077f582ec949c14bd7637

This XML file defines the structure and data types for various game components and entities within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining how different game elements are represented in the game's data files. This is crucial for understanding how game mechanics, AI behaviors, visual effects, and spawning logic are implemented. By defining these structures, the game engine knows how to read, interpret, and utilize the data associated with each component.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct part of a game entity or system. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Within each component, `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes. This can indicate the data type or complexity.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can range from primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, `double` to more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or custom classes like `class ConfigExplosion` or `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>`.

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Component>` elements containing multiple `<Var>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is broken down into its constituent variables, specifying their names, sizes, and data types.
*   **Data Type Variety:** A wide range of data types are used, from simple numerical and boolean types to complex string and vector types, reflecting the diverse needs of game systems.
*   **AI and Behavior Components:** Several components appear to define AI behaviors and combat logic, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`.
*   **Entity Spawning and Properties:** Components like `BossDragonComponent` and `MaterialSeaSpawnerComponent` suggest definitions for specific entities and their spawning or environmental properties.
*   **Configuration and Effects:** Components like `LightningComponent` indicate definitions for visual effects and their associated configurations.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.
```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables controlling attack probability, range, aiming, animation, and the projectile entity to be spawned.

**2. `BossDragonComponent`:**
This component likely defines the movement and behavior properties of a specific boss enemy.
```xml
  <Component component_name="BossDragonComponent" >
    <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="speed_hunt" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="acceleration" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="gravity" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="part_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
Here, variables like `speed`, `acceleration`, and `gravity` suggest how the dragon moves and interacts with the environment.

**3. `MaterialSeaSpawnerComponent`:**
This component appears to be responsible for spawning specific materials in a "sea" or fluid-like formation.
```xml
  <Component component_name="MaterialSeaSpawnerComponent" >
    <Var name="material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="size" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<int>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="offset" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<int>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="speed" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="sine_wavelength" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="noise_scale" size="8" type="double" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows parameters for the type of material to spawn (`material`), its spatial distribution (`size`, `offset`), and wave-like properties (`sine_wavelength`, `noise_scale`).
