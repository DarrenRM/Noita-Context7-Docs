# 6f88d371a84d0dbec93cd74b22628640

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with different game mechanics and entities. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data for entities, spells, enemies, and other game elements. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is organized and what parameters can be adjusted for each component.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. The root element is `<Schema>` which contains these components.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the specific game system it describes (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `DrugEffectComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. Each `<Var>` element defines a single variable or property associated with that component. The `<Var>` elements have the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `change_speed`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the data type.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. Common types include:
    *   `int`: Integer
    *   `float`: Floating-point number
    *   `bool`: Boolean (true/false)
    *   `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`: A string.

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their purpose is to define the variable's metadata rather than hold a specific value.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components. This allows for modularity and reusability of game logic.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a collection of variables, each with a specific name, size, and type. This provides a structured way to configure the behavior of game entities.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of standard data types are used, including integers for counts and durations, floats for measurements and probabilities, and booleans for flags. String types are used for names, file paths, and identifiers.
*   **AI and Behavior:** Several components relate to Artificial Intelligence and entity behavior, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`, defining parameters for combat, movement, and decision-making.
*   **Visual and Physical Properties:** Components like `PathFindingComponent` and those related to animations (implied by variable names like `image_animation_phase`) suggest definitions for how entities interact with the environment and how they are visually represented.
*   **Status Effects and Items:** Components like `DrugEffectComponent` indicate the game's system for handling status effects, buffs, and debuffs, likely tied to consumable items or spells.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities.

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
This shows variables controlling attack frequency (`use_probability`), range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), targeting angle (`angular_range_deg`), the animation played during an attack (`animation_name`), and the entity file used for ranged attacks (`attack_ranged_entity_file`).

**2. `DrugEffectComponent`:**
This component defines the parameters for various drug-induced status effects.

```xml
<Component component_name="DrugEffectComponent" >
  <Var name="change_speed" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="alcohol_amount" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="hallucinogen_amount" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="nightvision_amount" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="stoned_amount" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="alcohol_wear_off_speed" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
This component includes variables for modifying movement speed (`change_speed`), the intensity of various drug effects like alcohol (`alcohol_amount`), hallucinogens (`hallucinogen_amount`), night vision (`nightvision_amount`), and being stoned (`stoned_amount`), as well as how quickly these effects wear off (`alcohol_wear_off_speed`).

**3. `PathFindingComponent`:**
This component details parameters related to an entity's pathfinding capabilities.

```xml
<Component component_name="PathFindingComponent" >
  <Var name="search_depth_max_no_goal" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="iterations_max_no_goal" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="cost_of_flying" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="frames_to_get_stuck" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
This shows variables that control the maximum search depth for pathfinding when no specific goal is set (`search_depth_max_no_goal`), the maximum number of iterations for such searches (`iterations_max_no_goal`), the cost associated with flying movement (`cost_of_flying`), and how many frames an entity can be stuck before it's considered so (`frames_to_get_stuck`).
