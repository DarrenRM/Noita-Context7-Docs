# 378f94a58276e002efb14b8351605d55

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with different game entities and systems. This file is crucial for understanding how game objects behave, their attributes, and how they interact. It's a foundational piece of the game's data, dictating the parameters for everything from AI behavior to physics and audio.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. These components are identified by a `component_name` attribute. Within each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property of that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` for 2D vectors).

The structure is hierarchical, with the root `<Schema>` element containing all `<Component>` elements, and each `<Component>` containing its `<Var>` definitions.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined by individual `<Var>` tags, specifying their name, size, and data type.
*   **String Representation:** C++ string types are represented with a verbose `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Vector Types:** 2D vectors are represented using `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`.
*   **Boolean Representation:** Booleans are typically represented with a size of `1`.
*   **Numerical Types:** Integers and floats are common, with sizes of `4` bytes.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:** This component appears to define parameters related to an AI's attacking behavior.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows variables for attack range, angles, animation triggers, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

2.  **`AudioLoopComponent`:** This component seems to manage audio playback, specifically looping sounds.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AudioLoopComponent" >
      <Var name="file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="event_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="auto_play" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="play_on_component_enable" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    It includes fields for the audio file path, an event name, and flags to control automatic playback.

3.  **`GhostComponent`:** This component likely defines the behavior and properties of "ghost" entities in the game.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="GhostComponent" >
      <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="velocity" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="aggressiveness" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="target_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows variables for movement speed, velocity, aggression levels, and the type of target it might pursue.
