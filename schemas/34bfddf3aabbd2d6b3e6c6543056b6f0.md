# 34bfddf3aabbd2d6b3e6c6543056b6f0

This file defines the structure and data types for various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining how different game entities' properties are organized and what kind of data they hold. This is crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and manipulate game data, including entity behaviors, stats, and visual properties. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is structured.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct set of properties or functionalities that can be attached to game entities.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The identifier for the variable.
*   **`size`**: The memory size allocated for this variable (often in bytes).
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, or custom class types like `ceng::math::CVector2<float>`).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their purpose is to define the structure and metadata of the variable, not to hold its actual value.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="...">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game uses a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various components, each responsible for a specific aspect of their behavior or properties.
*   **AI and Behavior Components:** Many components seem to relate to Artificial Intelligence and entity behavior, such as `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, and components related to movement and states.
*   **Physics and Collision:** Components like `PlayerCollisionComponent` and variables related to velocity and position suggest a robust physics and collision system.
*   **Visual and Effect Properties:** Variables like `animation_name`, `effect_hit_ground`, and parameters for visual effects indicate definitions for how entities look and interact visually.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** The `type` attribute in `<Var>` elements is quite specific, often referencing C++ class types, which implies a direct mapping to the game's underlying C++ code.
*   **Numerical Data:** A significant portion of variables are numerical (`int`, `float`, `__int64`), used for values like damage, speed, distances, durations, and probabilities.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_landing_ranged_enabled`, `affect_flying`).
*   **String Identifiers:** `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` is used for string types, commonly for names of animations or entity files.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
This snippet from the `AIAttackComponent` defines parameters for an entity's attack behavior. `use_probability` likely controls how often an attack is attempted, `min_distance` and `max_distance` define the effective range, and `animation_name` specifies the visual animation associated with the attack.

**2. `IngestionComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="IngestionComponent" >
    <Var name="ingestion_size" size="8" type="__int64" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="ingestion_capacity" size="8" type="__int64" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="ingestion_cooldown_delay_frames" size="4" type="unsigned int" >
```
This section from the `IngestionComponent` suggests properties related to an entity's ability to consume or ingest other entities or materials. `ingestion_size` and `ingestion_capacity` likely define the volume or quantity that can be ingested, while `ingestion_cooldown_delay_frames` sets a delay before another ingestion can occur.

**3. `PlayerStatsComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="PlayerStatsComponent" >
    <Var name="lives" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_hp" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
```
This component defines core player statistics. `lives` tracks the number of remaining lives, `max_hp` sets the maximum health points, and `speed` determines the player's movement speed.
