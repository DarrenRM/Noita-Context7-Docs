# 0379e07dfac535998f56e590244f00c9

This XML file defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different game elements, such as AI behaviors, physical properties, and visual effects. By defining these components, the game engine knows how to interpret and utilize the data associated with entities, allowing for complex interactions and behaviors within the game world. This schema file is crucial for the game's internal data management and is a fundamental part of how Noita's entities are constructed and function.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains these components.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies the type of component it defines. Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements.

Each `<Var>` element defines a specific variable or property associated with that component. These `<Var>` elements have the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The structure is hierarchical, with the `<Schema>` at the top, containing multiple `<Component>`s, and each `<Component>` containing multiple `<Var>`s.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly demonstrates a component-based design. Each `<Component>` represents a self-contained piece of functionality or data that can be attached to game entities.
*   **Variable Definitions:** The `<Var>` tags are used to define the properties of each component. The `type` attribute is particularly important, indicating how the data for that variable should be interpreted (e.g., as a whole number, a decimal, a true/false value, or text).
*   **AI and Behavior Components:** A significant portion of the components seem to relate to Artificial Intelligence and entity behavior. Examples include `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, and `ControllerGoombaAIComponent`, which define parameters for how entities perceive, react, and act within the game.
*   **Physical and Environmental Components:** Other components define physical properties or environmental interactions, such as `LooseGroundComponent` (related to destructible terrain) and `NinjaRopeComponent` (likely for movement mechanics).
*   **Data Types:** Common data types observed are `int` (integers), `float` (floating-point numbers), `bool` (booleans), and `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (strings). The `size` attribute provides information about the memory footprint of these variables.
*   **Configuration Parameters:** Many variables appear to be configuration parameters that can be tweaked to alter entity behavior or properties. For instance, `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `max_distance`, and `state_duration_frames` in `AIAttackComponent` suggest fine-grained control over attack patterns.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component defines parameters for an entity's attack capabilities. It includes variables for the probability of using the attack, the range (minimum and maximum distance), the angular spread of the attack, how long the attack state lasts, the name of the animation associated with the attack, and details about ranged attacks such as the entity file to spawn, and the minimum/maximum count of entities to spawn.

**2. `ControllerGoombaAIComponent`:**
```xml
  <Component component_name="ControllerGoombaAIComponent" >
    <Var name="auto_turn_around_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="wait_to_turn_around" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="check_wall_detection" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="wall_detection_aabb_min_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="wall_detection_aabb_max_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component appears to define AI behavior for a specific type of enemy, possibly a "Goomba" equivalent. It includes settings for whether the AI should automatically turn around, how long it waits before turning, and parameters for detecting walls, including the bounding box used for wall detection.

**3. `LooseGroundComponent`:**
```xml
  <Component component_name="LooseGroundComponent" >
    <Var name="probability" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_durability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_angle" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_radius" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_radius" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="chunk_probability" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="chunk_max_angle" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component likely governs the behavior of destructible terrain or "loose ground." It defines properties such as the probability of it being loose, its durability, the distance and angle at which it can be affected, its size (min/max radius), and parameters related to how it breaks apart into chunks.
