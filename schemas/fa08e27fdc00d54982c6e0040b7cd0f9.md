# fa08e27fdc00d54982c6e0040b7cd0f9

This file, `fa08e27fdc00d54982c6e0040b7cd0f9.xml`, is a schema definition file for the game Noita. It defines the structure and types of data used by various game components. These schemas are crucial for understanding how game entities are configured and how their properties are stored and interpreted by the game engine. Essentially, it acts as a blueprint for the data that makes up game objects, their behaviors, and their physical properties.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct set of properties or functionalities that can be attached to game entities.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual data variables. Each `<Var>` has the following key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `max_speed`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`). The `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` type indicates a string.

The structure follows a pattern of:

```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="...">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several patterns and categories of components are evident from the sampled data:

*   **AI-related Components**: Components like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` define behaviors and parameters for artificial intelligence, including attack ranges, probabilities, and movement characteristics.
*   **Physics and Movement Components**: Components such as `PhysicsBodyComponent`, `GasBubbleComponent`, and `PhysicsBodyCollisionDamageComponent` deal with the physical properties of game objects, including gravity, speed, damping, and collision-based damage.
*   **Entity-Specific Data**: Components like `GenomeDataComponent` suggest data specific to certain types of entities, potentially related to their biological or genetic properties within the game world.
*   **Data Types**: A mix of fundamental types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ types (like `std::basic_string` for strings and `ceng::math::CVector2<float>` for 2D vectors) are used, indicating the underlying programming language and libraries.
*   **Component Naming Convention**: Component names are descriptive and often follow a PascalCase convention, clearly indicating their purpose (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `GasBubbleComponent`).

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability, range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), targeting angles (`angular_range_deg`), the animation associated with the attack (`animation_name`), and details about ranged attacks, such as the entity to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_file`) and the number of entities to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_count_min`, `attack_ranged_entity_count_max`).

**2. `GasBubbleComponent`**

```xml
  <Component component_name="GasBubbleComponent" >
    <Var name="acceleration" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component likely governs the behavior of gas bubbles or similar buoyant entities. It defines basic physics properties like `acceleration` and `max_speed`, which would influence how these entities move and interact with fluids.

**3. `PhysicsBodyComponent`**

```xml
  <Component component_name="PhysicsBodyComponent" >
    <Var name="is_external" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="hax_fix_going_through_ground" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="linear_damping" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_damping" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="allow_sleep" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component is fundamental for objects that interact with the game's physics engine. It includes flags for external physics influence (`is_external`), potential workarounds for physics glitches (`hax_fix_going_through_ground`), damping parameters to simulate friction (`linear_damping`, `angular_damping`), and a setting to allow the object to enter a sleep state when inactive (`allow_sleep`).
