# 33ccbd01a086729f144856e5de9762bc

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types, sizes, and names of variables that make up these components. These components are then likely used to define the behavior, appearance, and attributes of entities within the game, such as enemies, spells, and environmental objects. The `hash` attribute on the root `<Schema>` tag likely serves as a unique identifier for this specific schema definition.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements.

Each `<Var>` element defines a single variable within that component and has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string, or more complex C++ types like `struct LensValue<int>` or `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, indicating that their definition is solely based on their attributes and the context of their parent `<Component>`.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly follows a component-based design, where distinct functionalities are encapsulated into named components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, each with a specific name, size, and type. This allows for granular control over the data associated with each component.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including fundamental types like integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and booleans (`bool`), as well as more complex C++ types for strings and vector math.
*   **AI and Behavior:** Many components appear to be related to Artificial Intelligence and entity behavior. For example, `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` suggest definitions for how entities attack and generally behave.
*   **Physics and Movement:** Components like `FlyingComponent` and variables related to movement (`speed`, `direction`, `can_walk`, `can_fly`) indicate definitions for physics and locomotion.
*   **Spatial Properties:** Variables like `aabb_min`, `aabb_max`, and `space_required` suggest definitions for bounding boxes and spatial requirements.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
This snippet shows variables within the `AIAttackComponent`. It defines parameters for an entity's attack behavior, such as the probability of using an attack (`use_probability`), the minimum and maximum distances for attacks (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), the name of the attack animation (`animation_name`), and the entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks (`attack_ranged_entity_file`). The `size` attribute indicates the memory allocation for each variable.

**2. `AIComponent` Variables (partial):**
```xml
    <Var name="attack_dash_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_dash_frames_between" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_frames_between" size="12" type="struct LensValue<int>" >
    </Var>
```
This shows more AI-related variables, specifically for different attack types. `attack_dash_distance` and `attack_dash_frames_between` define parameters for a dash attack, while `attack_ranged_frames_between` specifies the cooldown or delay between ranged attacks, using a more complex `LensValue<int>` type.

**3. `FlyingComponent` and `FogOfWarRadiusComponent`:**
```xml
  <Component component_name="FlyingComponent" >

    <Var name="type" size="4" type="int" >

    </Var>

    <Var name="perlin_freq" size="4" type="float" >

    </Var>

    <Var name="perlin_wind_x" size="4" type="float" >

    </Var>

  </Component>

  <Component component_name="FogOfWarRadiusComponent" >

    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >

    </Var>

  </Component>
```
These components define specific functionalities. `FlyingComponent` likely controls entities that can fly, with variables for `type` and Perlin noise parameters (`perlin_freq`, `perlin_wind_x`) which could be used for simulating wind or flight patterns. `FogOfWarRadiusComponent` simply defines a `radius` for an entity's fog of war effect.
