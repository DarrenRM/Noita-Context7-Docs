# bc6b682123aa80523d29a1c3fdab86a6

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. These components are fundamental building blocks that dictate the behavior, appearance, and interactions of entities within the game world. Essentially, this file acts as a schema or blueprint for how different game elements are configured, allowing for a vast array of unique items, enemies, and environmental effects to be created. By defining these components, Noita can manage and instantiate complex game logic and data efficiently.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that likely identifies this specific schema definition.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `GameAreaEffectComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `mass`, `radius`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (string), `struct LensValue<float>`, `enum GAME_EFFECT::Enum`, `class PixelSprite *`, and `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>`.

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Var>` elements nested within their respective `<Component>` elements.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game utilizes a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file defines the available components and their configurable parameters.
*   **Data Types:** A mix of primitive data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ types are used, indicating a sophisticated underlying game engine. String types are frequently represented by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Numerical Properties:** Many components define numerical properties for behavior and physics, such as `min_distance`, `max_distance`, `gravity`, `mass`, `radius`, and `frame_length`.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are used extensively for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_enabled`, `flying_needs_recharge`, `disable_movement`).
*   **String Identifiers:** String types are used for names, file paths, and potentially identifiers for other game assets (e.g., `animation_name`, `attack_ranged_entity_file`, `collide_with_tag`, `custom_effect_id`).
*   **Enum Types:** The presence of `enum` types (e.g., `GAME_EFFECT::Enum`, `RAGDOLL_FX::Enum`) suggests that certain properties have a predefined set of possible values, providing type safety and clarity.
*   **Vector Types:** `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>` indicates the use of 2D vectors for properties like position or dimensions.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), accuracy (`angular_range_deg`), animation to play during an attack (`animation_name`), the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks (`attack_ranged_entity_file`), and whether to use a laser sight for ranged attacks (`attack_ranged_use_laser_sight`).

**2. `AIComponent` (partial sample):**

```xml
    <Var name="mass" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="gravity" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="fly_time_max" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="flying_needs_recharge" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```

This component appears to govern general AI behavior and physics. The sample shows properties related to physical attributes like `mass` and `gravity`, as well as flight mechanics, including maximum flight duration (`fly_time_max`) and whether flight requires recharging (`flying_needs_recharge`).

**3. `GameAreaEffectComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="GameAreaEffectComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="collide_with_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="frame_length" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="game_effect_entitities" size="12" type="class std::vector<class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >,class std::allocator<class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> > > >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines properties for an area-based game effect. It includes the `radius` of the effect, a tag for what it should collide with (`collide_with_tag`), its duration in frames (`frame_length`), and a list of game effect entities it can spawn or interact with (`game_effect_entitities`).
