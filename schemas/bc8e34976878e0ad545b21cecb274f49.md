# bc8e34976878e0ad545b21cecb274f49

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables that make up different game entities and their behaviors. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and utilize the data associated with entities like enemies, spells, and environmental objects. Essentially, this file is a blueprint for how game data is organized and what parameters can be adjusted for each component.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains these components.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the type of component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ElectricityReceiverComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. Each `<Var>` element defines a single variable within that component and has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `offset_x`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` (representing a 2D vector of floats).

There are no explicit values within the `<Var>` tags themselves; they only define the structure.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly follows a component-based design, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components. This allows for modularity and reusability of game logic.
*   **Variable Definitions:** The primary pattern is the definition of variables within each component, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This is fundamental for serialization and deserialization of game data.
*   **AI and Physics Focus:** Many components observed in the samples relate to Artificial Intelligence (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and physics (`PhysicsImageShapeComponent`). This suggests a significant portion of the game's behavior and physical interactions are defined here.
*   **String Representation:** The use of `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for string types indicates that string data is handled using C++'s standard string implementation.
*   **Vector Types:** The presence of `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` points to the use of a custom math library for handling 2D vectors, likely for positions, velocities, or directions.
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are of type `bool`, serving as flags to enable or disable specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_use_message`, `hack_is_material_crack`).

## Sample Entries

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_speed" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
This sample shows a component related to AI attacks. It defines parameters for attack probability, range, targeting angles, animation names, and details about ranged attacks, including the entity file to spawn, count limits, and aiming behavior.

**2. `ElectricityReceiverComponent` Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="ElectricityReceiverComponent" >
  <Var name="offset_x" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="offset_y" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="radius" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="active_time_frames" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="switch_on_msg_interval_frames" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="electrified_msg_interval_frames" size="4" type="int" >
</Component>
```
This component defines properties for entities that can receive and react to electricity. It includes positional offsets, a radius of effect, and timing parameters for activation and messaging related to being electrified.

**3. `PhysicsImageShapeComponent` Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="PhysicsImageShapeComponent" >
  <Var name="is_root" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="body_id" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="use_sprite" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="is_circle" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="centered" size="1" type="bool" >
</Component>
```
This component appears to be related to the physical representation of an entity. It includes flags for whether it's a root element, an identifier for its physics body, and properties related to its visual representation (using a sprite) and shape (circle, centered).
