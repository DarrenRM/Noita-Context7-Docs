# 613831e95c898860b669bfa8eeed9bee

This XML file, identified by the hash `613831e95c898860b669bfa8eeed9bee`, defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint, dictating how different game entities and their behaviors are represented in the game's data. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to understand and instantiate objects, characters, and their associated mechanics. Essentially, this file is a foundational piece of Noita's data-driven design, allowing for complex game logic to be defined and managed through structured data.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute that identifies it.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define the individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their purpose is to define the structure and type of data, not to hold specific values.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="ComponentName">
    <Var name="variable_name_1" size="4" type="int">
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_2" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >">
    </Var>
    </Component>
  <Component component_name="AnotherComponent">
    </Component>
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several patterns emerge from the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various functional components (e.g., AI, Physics, Hitbox).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying the name, size, and data type.
*   **Data Types:** Common data types include integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and string types (represented by `class std::basic_string<...>`).
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names often reflect their purpose, such as `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `attack_melee_damage_min`, `aabb_max_x`, etc.
*   **Attack-Related Components:** There are numerous components and variables related to combat and attacks, including melee and ranged attacks, damage, knockback, and aiming.
*   **Physics and Collision:** Components like `HitboxComponent` and `PhysicsShapeComponent` define physical properties and collision detection.
*   **AI Behavior:** Components like `AIComponent` and `AIAttackComponent` suggest definitions for enemy or NPC behavior.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      </Component>
    ```
    This component likely defines the parameters for an AI's attack behavior. It includes variables for attack probability, range, targeting angles, duration, animation, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

2.  **`HitboxComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="HitboxComponent" >
      <Var name="is_player" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_enemy" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_item" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="aabb_min_x" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="aabb_max_x" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="aabb_min_y" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="aabb_max_y" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_multiplier" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines the collision and hit detection properties of an entity. It specifies whether the entity is a player, enemy, or item, its bounding box extents (`aabb_min_x`, `aabb_max_x`, etc.), and a damage multiplier.

3.  **`PhysicsShapeComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PhysicsShapeComponent" >
      <Var name="recreate" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_circle" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_box" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_capsule" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_based_on_sprite" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="friction" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="restitution" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component describes the physical shape and properties of an entity for the physics engine. It includes flags for shape type (circle, box, capsule), whether it's derived from a sprite, and physical properties like friction and restitution.
