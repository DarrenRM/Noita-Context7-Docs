# 1f2e8bf3ba1a0366b740c10c460ac6b0

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their properties within Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different game elements, such as AI behaviors, character statistics, collision triggers, inventory systems, and particle emitters. This schema is crucial for the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data associated with these components, enabling the creation of diverse entities and their interactions.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains these components.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the type of component it defines. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which represent individual variables or properties of that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `struct ceng::math::CVector2<int>`, `enum PARTICLE_EMITTER_CUSTOM_STYLE::Enum`).

The content within a `<Var>` tag is typically empty, indicating that the definition is solely based on its attributes.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly follows a component-based design, where game entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, detailing its configurable parameters.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** The `type` attribute provides specific information about the kind of data each variable holds, ranging from primitive types to complex C++ class/struct representations.
*   **String Representation:** String types are represented by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, indicating they are standard C++ strings.
*   **Vector Types:** 2D vectors are represented by `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>`, suggesting a structure for holding two integer components.
*   **Enum Types:** The presence of `enum` types like `PARTICLE_EMITTER_CUSTOM_STYLE::Enum` indicates that certain variables can take values from a predefined set of enumerations.
*   **Transform Data:** The `struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>` suggests a structure for representing transformation matrices or similar geometric data.

## Sample Entries

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack behavior.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This sample shows variables for attack probabilities, distances, angles, durations, animation names, and parameters for ranged attacks, including the entity file to spawn and its count.

2.  **`CollisionTriggerComponent`**: This component defines properties for entities that act as collision triggers.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="CollisionTriggerComponent" >
      <Var name="width" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="height" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="required_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="remove_component_when_triggered" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="destroy_this_entity_when_triggered" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="timer_for_destruction" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This illustrates variables for defining the collision shape (width, height, radius), a tag required for triggering, and actions to take upon being triggered (removing components, destroying the entity, or a timer for destruction).

3.  **`ParticleEmitterComponent` (implied by sample)**: Although not explicitly shown as a full component in the samples, the presence of variables like `custom_style`, `delay_frames`, `is_emitting`, `use_material_inventory`, `image_animation_file`, and `image_animation_colors_file` strongly suggests a `ParticleEmitterComponent` or a similar component responsible for visual effects.
    ```xml
    <Var name="custom_style" size="4" type="enum PARTICLE_EMITTER_CUSTOM_STYLE::Enum" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="delay_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_emitting" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="use_material_inventory" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="image_animation_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    ```
    These variables indicate control over particle emission, timing, visual appearance (custom styles, animations), and potential use of materials.
