# 7f73aa66f710f08658123af18b01cbf4

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. These components are fundamental building blocks that dictate the behavior, appearance, and functionality of entities in the game, such as enemies, items, and environmental elements. By defining these components, the game can systematically assemble and manage complex game objects. This file acts as a schema, outlining the types of data and their attributes that each component can hold.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables or properties associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class std::vector<...>` (which represents a dynamic array).

The structure is hierarchical: the root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various components, each responsible for a specific aspect of their behavior or properties.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying their name, size, and data type. This provides a structured way to serialize and deserialize game data.
*   **Data Type Variety:** The file showcases a range of data types, from simple booleans and integers to complex string and vector types, indicating the diverse nature of game object properties.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Component and variable names are generally descriptive, hinting at their purpose (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `radius`, `damage_amount`).
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are booleans (`size="1" type="bool"`), often used to enable or disable specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_enabled`, `drop_as_item`).
*   **Numerical Properties:** Floats and integers are frequently used for numerical values such as distances, speeds, probabilities, and counts.
*   **String References:** String types are used for names of animations, entity files, or other textual identifiers.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component appears to define the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack range, probability, animation, and the specific entity file to be used for ranged attacks, along with its count.

2.  **`BlackHoleComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="BlackHoleComponent" >
      <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="particle_attractor_force" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_probability" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_amount" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component likely defines the properties of a black hole effect. It specifies its `radius`, the `particle_attractor_force` it exerts, and its `damage_probability` and `damage_amount` to entities caught within its influence.

3.  **`ItemAIKnowledgeComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ItemAIKnowledgeComponent" >
      <Var name="is_ranged_weapon" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_throwable_weapon" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_melee_weapon" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_self_healing" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component seems to store information about an item's classification, particularly from an AI's perspective. It uses boolean flags to indicate if an item is a ranged weapon, throwable, melee weapon, or a self-healing item.
