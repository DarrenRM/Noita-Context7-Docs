# ccebe205c2db2a84426f0957ea37c227

This XML file, identified by the hash `ccebe205c2db2a84426f0957ea37c227`, defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. These components are fundamental building blocks that dictate the behavior, appearance, and interactions of entities in the game, such as enemies, items, and environmental elements. By defining these components, the game engine knows how to interpret and utilize them to create the complex world and gameplay mechanics of Noita. This file acts as a schema, outlining the expected data fields and their types for each component.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a root `<Schema>` element containing multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `enum`).

The `type` attribute often includes C++-like type names, indicating the underlying data representation. For string types, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` is commonly used. For enumerated types, the enum name (e.g., `GAME_EFFECT::Enum`) is specified.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly demonstrates a component-based design pattern, where game entities are composed of various independent components, each responsible for a specific aspect of their functionality.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, which are essentially parameters that can be configured to alter the component's behavior.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** The `type` attribute provides crucial information about how data for each variable should be interpreted, ranging from simple numerical types to complex string representations and enumerated values.
*   **String Representation:** String data, particularly for names of animations, materials, or entity files, is consistently represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Enum Usage:** Enumerated types are used to represent a fixed set of possible values for certain properties, providing a more readable and type-safe way to define options (e.g., `GAME_EFFECT::Enum`, `HIT_EFFECT::Enum`).
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are used for simple on/off settings or flags.
*   **Numerical Properties:** `int` and `float` types are used for numerical values such as probabilities, distances, durations, offsets, and physical properties like friction and density.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component appears to define parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This snippet shows variables like `use_probability` (an integer), `min_distance` and `max_distance` (floats defining attack range), `animation_name` (a string for the attack animation), and parameters for ranged attacks such as `attack_ranged_entity_file` and the count of entities to spawn.

**2. `HitEffectComponent`:**
This component seems to define the effects that occur when an entity is hit.

```xml
  <Component component_name="HitEffectComponent" >
    <Var name="condition_effect" size="4" type="enum GAME_EFFECT::Enum" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="condition_status" size="4" type="enum STATUSEFFECT_TYPE::Enum" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="effect_hit" size="4" type="enum HIT_EFFECT::Enum" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="value" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="value_string" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
Here, `condition_effect` and `condition_status` likely specify conditions under which the hit effect is applied, using enumerated types. `effect_hit` defines the type of effect, and `value` and `value_string` might represent the magnitude or specific details of that effect.

**3. `PhysicsThrowableComponent`:**
This component defines properties related to objects that can be thrown.

```xml
  <Component component_name="PhysicsThrowableComponent" >
    <Var name="throw_force_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_throw_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows basic parameters for throwable objects, such as `throw_force_coeff` (a float likely controlling the force applied when thrown) and `max_throw_speed` (a float for the maximum velocity achievable).
