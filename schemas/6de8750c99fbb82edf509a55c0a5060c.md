# 6de8750c99fbb82edf509a55c0a5060c

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and sizes for variables associated with different game entities and mechanics. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and utilize the data for entities such as enemies, environmental objects, and special effects. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is organized and what parameters can be adjusted for each component.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains all the component definitions.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `BlackHoleComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. Each `<Var>` element defines a specific variable within that component and has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum` for enumerations).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are empty, indicating that this file defines the *structure* of the data, not its specific values.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="6de8750c99fbb82edf509a55c0a5060c" >

  <Component component_name="ComponentName" >
    <Var name="variable_name_1" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_2" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_3" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    </Component>

  </Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's functionality is broken down into modular components, each with its own set of configurable parameters.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** The `size` and `type` attributes provide precise information about how data is stored, which is crucial for efficient memory management and serialization.
*   **String Representation:** String types are consistently represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, indicating a standard C++ string implementation.
*   **Boolean Representation:** Booleans are typically represented with `size="1"` and `type="bool"`.
*   **Numerical Types:** Integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`) are common, with varying `size` attributes (e.g., `size="4"` for standard 32-bit types).
*   **Enumerations:** Some variables, like `type` in `PhysicsJointComponent`, are defined as `enum` types, suggesting a set of predefined values.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `damage_amount`).

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component appears to define parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows variables for attack probability, range, targeting angles, animation names, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

2.  **`BlackHoleComponent`**: This component likely defines the properties of a black hole effect.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="BlackHoleComponent" >
      <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="particle_attractor_force" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_probability" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_amount" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    It includes parameters for the black hole's radius, its force on particles, and the damage it inflicts.

3.  **`PhysicsJoint2MutatorComponent`**: This component seems to be related to physics joints and their modifications.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PhysicsJoint2MutatorComponent" >
      <Var name="joint_id" size="2" type="unsigned short" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="destroy" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="motor_speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mBox2DJointId" size="8" type="unsigned __int64" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This illustrates variables for a joint's ID, whether it can be destroyed, motor speed, and a 64-bit identifier for a Box2D joint.
