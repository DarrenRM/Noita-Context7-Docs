# c6be54c3e20ac2d2068b297049c42035

This XML file, identified by the hash `c6be54c3e20ac2d2068b297049c42035`, defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with different game entities and mechanics. This file is crucial for the game's engine to understand and interpret how various elements behave, from AI actions to physical properties and special effects. By defining these components, the game can dynamically load and configure entities, allowing for a rich and varied gameplay experience.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual variables.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that identifies the schema itself.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ElectricChargeComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a single variable within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `collision_aabb_min_x`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, as well as more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or custom structs like `struct LensValue<float>`.

The structure is hierarchical, with components containing variables. The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their purpose is to define the schema rather than hold specific values.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game appears to use a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file defines the properties of these components.
*   **Variable Naming Conventions:** Variable names are generally descriptive, often using camelCase or snake_case. Prefixes like `attack_ranged_` or `collision_aabb_` indicate the context or purpose of the variable.
*   **Data Type Variety:** A range of data types are used, from simple booleans and integers to floating-point numbers and complex C++ class/struct representations. This allows for fine-grained control over game mechanics.
*   **Physics and AI Focus:** The samples highlight components related to AI behavior (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and physics (`PhysicsPickUpComponent`, `PhysicsRagdollComponent`), suggesting these are core areas defined by this schema.
*   **Effect and Status Components:** Components like `ElectricChargeComponent` and variables related to drugs (`alcohol_wear_off_speed`, `hallucinogen_wear_off_speed`) indicate the definition of various status effects and environmental interactions.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. Variables like `use_probability`, `min_distance`, and `max_distance` control when and how an AI attacks. `animation_name` likely dictates the visual animation associated with the attack, and `attack_ranged_entity_file` probably specifies the projectile or entity spawned during a ranged attack.

**2. `AIComponent` Physics-Related Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="AIComponent" >
  <Var name="collision_aabb_min_x" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="collision_aabb_max_x" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="mass" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="gravity" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="flying_needs_recharge" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This snippet from the `AIComponent` shows variables related to an AI's physical properties. `collision_aabb_min_x/max_x` define the bounding box for collision detection. `mass` and `gravity` are fundamental physics properties, while `flying_needs_recharge` suggests a mechanic for aerial movement.

**3. `ElectricChargeComponent` Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="ElectricChargeComponent" >
  <Var name="charge_time_frames" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="electricity_emission_interval_frames" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="fx_emission_interval_min" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="fx_emission_interval_max" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This component defines parameters for electrical effects. `charge_time_frames` likely controls how long an entity needs to charge up. `electricity_emission_interval_frames` and the `fx_emission_interval` variables suggest control over the timing and frequency of electrical discharges or visual effects.
