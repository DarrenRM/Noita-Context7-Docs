# f83da7a8f27777d10d27997d61b6fb84

This XML file, identified by the hash `f83da7a8f27777d10d27997d61b6fb84`, defines the data structures and components used within the game Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the properties and types of various game elements, such as entities, their behaviors, and their physical attributes. This file is crucial for the game's engine to understand and instantiate game objects, their interactions, and their visual representations. Modders can use this schema as a reference to understand how game data is organized and to create or modify game content.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component or entity behavior and is identified by a `component_name` attribute.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `class std::vector<int,class std::allocator<int> >`, `struct ValueRange`).

The `<Var>` elements can be empty, indicating that the variable's value is defined elsewhere or is implicitly handled by the game engine.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The game's data is organized around components, where each component encapsulates a specific set of functionalities or properties. This is a common pattern in game development for modularity and reusability.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a series of variables, detailing its configurable parameters. These variables cover a wide range of game mechanics, from AI behavior to physical properties and visual effects.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types like integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and booleans (`bool`), as well as more complex C++ types like strings (`class std::basic_string...`) and vectors (`class std::vector...`).
*   **AI Components:** Several components relate to Artificial Intelligence, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`, suggesting detailed control over enemy behavior, including attack patterns, movement, and decision-making.
*   **Physical and Material Interactions:** Components like `CellEaterComponent` and `CharacterCollisionComponent` indicate definitions for how entities interact with the game world's materials and physics.
*   **Visual and Effect Components:** Components like the one sampled from lines 3980-4030, which includes variables like `color`, `offset`, and `area_circle_radius`, suggest definitions for particle effects, visual emitters, and spatial properties.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` (from the first 100 lines):**

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability, range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), targeting angle (`angular_range_deg`), attack duration, associated animations, and properties of ranged attacks like the entity file to spawn and the number of entities to spawn.

**2. `CellEaterComponent` (from lines 966-1016):**

```xml
<Component component_name="CellEaterComponent" >
  <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="eat_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="ignored_material" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="materials" size="12" type="class std::vector<int,class std::allocator<int> >" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This component likely defines entities that can consume or "eat" specific materials in the game world. It specifies the radius of consumption, the probability of eating, a material to ignore, and a list of materials (`materials`) that it *can* eat.

**3. Particle/Emitter Component (from lines 3980-4030):**

```xml
<Var name="collide_with_gas_and_fire" size="1" type="bool" >
</Var>
<Var name="emitter_lifetime_frames" size="4" type="int" >
</Var>
<Var name="color" size="4" type="unsigned int" >
</Var>
<Var name="offset" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
</Var>
<Var name="area_circle_radius" size="8" type="struct ValueRange" >
</Var>
```

This snippet, likely part of a larger component related to visual effects or emitters, defines properties such as collision behavior with environmental elements (`collide_with_gas_and_fire`), the lifespan of an emitter, color properties, positional offsets, and the radius of an area, potentially for particle spawning.
