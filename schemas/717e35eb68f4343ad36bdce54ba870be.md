# 717e35eb68f4343ad36bdce54ba870be

This XML file defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint for how different game entities and their behaviors are structured and configured. These components dictate aspects like AI behavior, physics, visual effects, and more, allowing for the creation of diverse enemies, items, and environmental interactions within the game. Understanding this schema is crucial for analyzing and potentially modifying game data.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a root `<Schema>` element containing multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` represents a distinct type of game logic or behavior and has a `component_name` attribute. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property for that component.

Each `<Var>` element typically has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The structure is hierarchical, with the `<Schema>` at the top, followed by individual `<Component>` definitions, and then the specific `<Var>` properties within each component.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `FogOfWarRemoverComponent`).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying their name, size, and data type. This provides a structured way to represent data.
*   **String Representation:** String data types are represented by a verbose C++-like type: `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`. This indicates how strings are handled internally.
*   **Numerical Data Types:** Common numerical types like `int` and `float` are used extensively for parameters such as distances, probabilities, durations, and coefficients.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` type is used for simple on/off states or flags.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for the probability of using an attack, the minimum and maximum distances for attacks, the angular range in degrees, and the name of the animation associated with the attack.

**2. `AIComponent` Variables (partial):**
```xml
    <Var name="rotate_in_hand_amount" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="rotate_hand_amount" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="fast_projectile" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="base_item_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
This snippet from the `AIComponent` shows variables related to item handling and projectile behavior. `rotate_in_hand_amount` and `rotate_hand_amount` likely control how an AI holds or manipulates items. `fast_projectile` is a boolean flag indicating if projectiles fired by this AI are fast. `base_item_file` specifies the file path for a base item associated with the AI.

**3. `FossilComponent` Variables:**
```xml
  <Component component_name="FossilComponent" >

    <Var name="count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="seed" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="material" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="image_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

  </Component>
```
This component defines properties for "fossils" within the game. It includes minimum and maximum counts, a seed for generation, the material type, and an image file associated with the fossil.
