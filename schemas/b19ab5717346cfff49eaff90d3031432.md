# b19ab5717346cfff49eaff90d3031432

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within the game Noita. It acts as a blueprint for how different game entities (like characters, enemies, items, and AI behaviors) are structured and configured. By defining these components and their properties, the game engine knows how to load, interpret, and utilize these elements to create the game world, its inhabitants, and their interactions. This file is crucial for understanding the underlying data structure of game assets and is a primary reference for modders.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a root `<Schema>` element, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The content of a `<Var>` element is typically empty, indicating that the variable's value is defined elsewhere or is a placeholder within the schema.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly demonstrates a component-based design, where functionality is broken down into modular components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `CharacterDataComponent`, `ItemComponent`).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables that specify its properties and behaviors.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types like integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and complex types like strings (represented by `class std::basic_string...`).
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `collision_aabb_min_x`, `item_name`).
*   **Structural Elements:** The XML structure is consistent, with `<Schema>` at the top, followed by multiple `<Component>` tags, and then `<Var>` tags within each component.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      </Component>
    ```
    This component likely defines the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability, range, angular targeting, animation names, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

2.  **`CharacterDataComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="CharacterDataComponent" >
      <Var name="platforming_type" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="collision_aabb_min_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="collision_aabb_max_y" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mass" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="gravity" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      </Component>
    ```
    This component seems to define fundamental physical and collision properties of a character or entity. It includes variables for platforming behavior, bounding box dimensions (`collision_aabb`), mass, and gravity. The `struct LensValue<float>` type suggests a more complex data structure for some values.

3.  **`ItemComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ItemComponent" >
      <Var name="item_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_stackable" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_consumable" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="auto_pickup" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      </Component>
    ```
    This component defines properties related to in-game items. It includes variables for the item's name, whether it can be stacked, if it's consumable, and if it should be automatically picked up.
