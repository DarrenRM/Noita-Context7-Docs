# 395236cc57709536eb2560585ff82b6e

This file defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the structure and data types for different aspects of game entities, such as AI behavior, physics, inventory, and more. By defining these components, the game engine knows how to interpret and utilize the data associated with each entity, enabling complex interactions and behaviors. This schema file is crucial for understanding how game objects are configured and how their properties are represented.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game logic or data container and has a `component_name` attribute.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties within that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable.
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the data type.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. Common types include `int`, `float`, `bool`, and various string types (e.g., `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`). Complex types like vectors are also represented (e.g., `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>`).

The structure is hierarchical: `<Schema>` contains `<Component>`s, and `<Component>`s contain `<Var>`s.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components. This allows for modularity and reusability of game logic.
*   **Variable Definition**: Each variable within a component is explicitly defined with its name, size, and type. This provides a clear contract for how data should be stored and accessed.
*   **Data Type Representation**: The `type` attribute uses C++-like naming conventions for primitive types and standard library types, indicating the underlying implementation.
*   **Boolean Flags**: Many variables are of type `bool` (represented by `size="1"`), used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_enabled`, `levitate`).
*   **Numerical Properties**: `int` and `float` types are used extensively for numerical values such as distances, speeds, probabilities, durations, and multipliers.
*   **String Identifiers**: String types are used for names, animations, entity files, and messages.
*   **Vector Types**: For 2D or 3D spatial data, vector types like `ceng::math::CVector2<int>` are used.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities. It includes settings for attack probability, range, angular targeting, animation names, the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks, and whether to use a laser sight.

2.  **`AIComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
      <Var name="creature_detection_angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance_to_cam_to_start_hunting" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="aggressiveness_min" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_melee_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_static_turret" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component outlines general AI behavior. It covers aspects like creature detection range, proximity to the camera for initiating hunting, aggressiveness levels, and whether the entity is a static turret.

3.  **`ItemAIKnowledgeComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ItemAIKnowledgeComponent" >
      <Var name="is_ranged_weapon" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_throwable_weapon" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_self_healing" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component seems to be associated with items, specifically defining their properties from an AI's perspective. It includes boolean flags to indicate if an item is a ranged weapon, a throwable weapon, or provides self-healing.

4.  **`PhysicsBodyCollisionDamageComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PhysicsBodyCollisionDamageComponent" >
      <Var name="speed_threshold" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_multiplier" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines how physics-based collisions result in damage. It specifies a `speed_threshold` that must be met for damage to occur and a `damage_multiplier` to scale the damage dealt.
