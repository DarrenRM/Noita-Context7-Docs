# 51bb753ce8e0116f8adddad81486a800

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables within different game systems. These components likely govern the behavior, attributes, and interactions of entities within the game world, such as enemies, player abilities, environmental effects, and more. By defining these components, the game engine can correctly load, interpret, and utilize the data associated with each game element.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. The root element `<Schema>` contains these components.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the specific component being defined. Inside each component, there are `<Var>` elements, which represent individual variables or properties of that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `struct LensValue<float>`, `enum EXPLOSION_TRIGGER_TYPE::Enum`, `class ConfigExplosion`).

Some `<Var>` elements may contain nested structures or be of complex types, indicated by types like `struct LensValue<float>` or `class ConfigExplosion`.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="51bb753ce8e0116f8adddad81486a800" >

  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <!-- ... other variables ... -->
  </Component>

  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    <!-- ... variables for AIComponent ... -->
  </Component>

  <!-- ... other components ... -->

</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where distinct functionalities are encapsulated within named components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This allows for structured data representation.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including fundamental types like `int`, `float`, and `bool`, as well as more complex C++-like types such as `std::basic_string` (likely for string data), `struct LensValue<float>` (suggesting a structured value for floats, possibly with min/max or other modifiers), `enum` types, and custom `class` types (like `ConfigExplosion`).
*   **AI and Physics Focus:** Several components observed in the samples, such as `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `CharacterPlatformingComponent`, and components related to explosions and physics (`ExplodeOnDamageComponent`, `ExplosionComponent`), suggest a strong focus on defining the behavior and physical interactions of game entities.
*   **Configuration Objects:** The presence of types like `class ConfigExplosion` indicates that some variables might reference more complex, pre-defined configuration objects rather than just simple primitive values.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes probabilities, distance ranges, angular constraints, and the name of an animation associated with the attack. The `animation_name` is a string type.

2.  **`CharacterPlatformingComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="velocity_min_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="velocity_max_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="jump_velocity_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This component appears to govern character movement and jumping. It uses a `struct LensValue<float>` for minimum and maximum velocities, suggesting a more complex way to define velocity ranges than just simple min/max floats. `jump_velocity_y` is a straightforward float for vertical jump force.

3.  **`ExplosionComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="trigger" size="4" type="enum EXPLOSION_TRIGGER_TYPE::Enum" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="config_explosion" size="356" type="class ConfigExplosion" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="timeout_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This component defines properties related to explosions. It includes an enum for the explosion trigger type, a reference to a `ConfigExplosion` object (likely containing detailed explosion parameters), and a timeout in frames.
