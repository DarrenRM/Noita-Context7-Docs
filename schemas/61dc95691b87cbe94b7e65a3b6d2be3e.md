# 61dc95691b87cbe94b7e65a3b6d2be3e

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint, outlining the data fields and their types for different game entities, behaviors, and attributes. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to understand and instantiate objects, enemies, spells, and other game elements. Essentially, it's a data dictionary that dictates how game logic and properties are represented.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute that identifies it.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual data variables or properties associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `speed`, `is_weapon`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This often correlates with the `type`.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. Common types observed include:
    *   `int`: Integer numbers.
    *   `float`: Floating-point numbers.
    *   `bool`: Boolean values (true/false).
    *   `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`: A string type.
    *   `class std::vector<struct PathFindingJumpParams,class std::allocator<struct PathFindingJumpParams> >`: A vector of a specific struct type.

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their definition is contained within their attributes.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="61dc95691b87cbe94b7e65a3b6d2be3e" >

  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <!-- ... other variables ... -->
  </Component>

  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    <!-- ... variables for AIComponent ... -->
  </Component>

</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several patterns emerge from the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game appears to use a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `BookComponent`, `BossDragonComponent`, `ItemActionComponent`, `ItemAlchemyComponent`).
*   **Categorization of Variables:** Variables within components are generally grouped by their function. For instance, `AIAttackComponent` contains variables related to attack parameters like distance, angles, timing, and projectile spawning. `BossDragonComponent` has variables related to movement and speed.
*   **Data Type Consistency:** For similar concepts across different components, data types tend to be consistent. For example, movement speeds are consistently represented as `float`.
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are booleans (`type="bool"`) and often prefixed with `is_` (e.g., `is_self_buffing`, `is_weapon`, `can_walk`). These likely control specific behaviors or states.
*   **String Identifiers:** String types (`class std::basic_string...`) are used for names, IDs, or file paths (e.g., `animation_name`, `attack_ranged_entity_file`, `action_id`).
*   **Numerical Parameters:** `int` and `float` types are used extensively for numerical values such as probabilities, distances, durations, speeds, and amounts.
*   **Specialized Components:** The presence of components like `BookComponent`, `BossDragonComponent`, `ItemActionComponent`, and `ItemAlchemyComponent` indicates specialized systems for different game elements.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

*   **Explanation:** This snippet from the `AIAttackComponent` defines parameters for an AI's attack behavior. `use_probability` likely controls how often the AI attempts to attack. `min_distance` and `max_distance` define the effective range. `angular_range_deg` specifies the cone of fire. `animation_name` and `attack_ranged_entity_file` suggest that attacks are tied to specific animations and can involve spawning projectile entities defined in other game files.

**2. `BossDragonComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="BossDragonComponent" >

    <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="speed_hunt" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="acceleration" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="direction_adjust_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="direction_adjust_speed_hunt" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="gravity" size="4" type="float" >
```

*   **Explanation:** This section defines movement properties for a "BossDragon". It includes base `speed`, a potentially faster `speed_hunt` for aggressive pursuit, `acceleration` for how quickly it reaches its speed, and `direction_adjust_speed` parameters for maneuvering. The inclusion of `gravity` suggests it's affected by physics.

**3. `ItemAlchemyComponent` and `PathFindingJumpParams` related variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="ItemAlchemyComponent" >

    <Var name="material_make_always_cast" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="material_remove_shuffle" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="material_animate_wand" size="4" type="int" >

  </Component>

  <Component component_name="PathFindingComponent" > <!-- Assuming this is the parent for jump params -->

    <Var name="can_walk" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="can_jump" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="jump_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="jump_trajectories" size="12" type="class std::vector<struct PathFindingJumpParams,class std::allocator<struct PathFindingJumpParams> >" >
    </Var>

  </Component>
```

*   **Explanation:** The `ItemAlchemyComponent` seems to define parameters related to how alchemical materials interact with wands or casting, possibly related to creating, removing, or animating effects. The latter part shows variables related to pathfinding, specifically movement capabilities like `can_walk` and `can_jump`, and detailed `jump_speed` and `jump_trajectories` which likely define how an entity navigates the game world. The `jump_trajectories` variable, being a vector of a custom struct, indicates complex data for defining movement paths.
