# 38f1e1adab4488613b6ba62dee6bdc63

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. These components dictate the behavior, attributes, and functionalities of entities, spells, enemies, and other game elements. Essentially, this file acts as a blueprint for how different parts of the game world operate and interact. It's a crucial part of the game's data that governs everything from enemy AI to the physics of throwable objects.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables or properties associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`).

The structure can be summarized as:

```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="...">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The entire file is organized around distinct components, suggesting a modular approach to game design where entities are composed of various functional units.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's behavior is defined by a set of variables, specifying parameters like probabilities, distances, durations, entity files, and physical properties.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ class types (e.g., `std::basic_string`, `ConfigDamagesByType`, `ConfigDrugFx`). These complex types likely represent nested data structures or custom game objects.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are generally descriptive, indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `max_hp`, `drone_entity_file`).
*   **Size Attribute:** The `size` attribute provides information about the memory footprint of each variable, which is relevant for low-level data handling.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component appears to define the parameters for an AI's attack behavior.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This section details how an AI decides to attack, its range, and what projectile or entity it uses for ranged attacks.

2.  **`AIComponent` (partial sample)**: This component likely serves as a base for AI-related logic. The sample shows variables related to health and damage.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
      <Var name="max_hp" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_hp_cap" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="damage_multipliers" size="60" type="class ConfigDamagesByType" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="falling_damages" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="air_needed" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This indicates that AI entities have configurable health, damage resistances, and can be affected by environmental factors like falling or needing air.

3.  **`PhysicsThrowableComponent`**: This component defines the physics properties for objects that can be thrown.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PhysicsThrowableComponent" >
      <Var name="throw_force_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_throw_speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_torque" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_torque" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attach_to_surfaces_knife_style" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component controls how much force is applied when throwing, the maximum speed, rotational properties (torque), and whether the object can stick to surfaces.
