# 814fda8f591a9b2a037830de1e37e43c

This XML file, identified by the hash `814fda8f591a9b2a037830de1e37e43c`, defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and types of data that can be associated with different game entities and systems. These schemas are crucial for the game's internal workings, dictating how entities behave, interact, and are represented. For modders, understanding these schemas is fundamental to creating new content or modifying existing game elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual variables or properties associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `GameEffectComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `effect`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ConfigExplosion`.

The structure is hierarchical: the schema contains components, and components contain variables.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's functionality is broken down into modular components, each with its own set of configurable properties.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each `<Var>` tag meticulously defines a single property, including its name, size, and data type. This allows for precise data management and serialization.
*   **Data Types:** A mix of fundamental data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and complex C++ types are used. The presence of `class std::basic_string` indicates string-based properties, while `class ConfigExplosion` suggests that some variables can hold complex nested configurations.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `attack_melee_damage_max`, `attack_ranged_offset_x`, `disable_movement`).
*   **AI and Game Effects:** The sampled components (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `GameEffectComponent`) highlight the schema's role in defining artificial intelligence behaviors and visual/gameplay effects.
*   **Physical Properties:** Components like the one containing `material`, `diggable`, and `create_box2d_bodies` suggest definitions for physical world elements.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet from the `AIAttackComponent` defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities. `use_probability` and `min_distance`/`max_distance` control when and how far an attack can be initiated. `animation_name` specifies the animation to play during an attack, and `attack_ranged_entity_file` likely points to the entity file that is spawned when a ranged attack is performed.

**2. `AIComponent` Melee Attack Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="attack_melee_damage_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_melee_impulse_vector_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_melee_offset_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_melee_finish_config_explosion" size="356" type="class ConfigExplosion" >
    </Var>
```

This section from the `AIComponent` details melee attack properties. `attack_melee_damage_max` sets the maximum damage for a melee strike. `attack_melee_impulse_vector_x` and `attack_melee_offset_x` likely define the force and position of the melee attack. The `attack_melee_finish_config_explosion` variable indicates that a melee attack can trigger a complex explosion configuration upon completion.

**3. `GameEffectComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="GameEffectComponent" >

    <Var name="effect" size="4" type="enum GAME_EFFECT::Enum" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="custom_effect_id" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="disable_movement" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```

This component defines properties for game effects. `effect` uses an enum to specify the type of game effect. `custom_effect_id` allows for custom effect identification. `frames` likely controls the duration of the effect, and `disable_movement` is a boolean flag that can prevent movement while the effect is active.
