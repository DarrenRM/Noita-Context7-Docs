# bb42c09d65e5341a59f1f6cdc005758f

This XML file, identified by the hash `bb42c09d65e5341a59f1f6cdc005758f`, defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types, sizes, and names of variables that make up these components. These components are fundamental building blocks for entities in the game, dictating their behavior, appearance, and interactions. By defining these structures, the game engine knows how to load, interpret, and utilize the data associated with each component for different game objects, such as enemies, items, or environmental elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual variables.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema definition.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `Inventory2Component`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a single variable within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `name`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>` (representing a 2D vector of integers).

The overall structure is a hierarchical definition of components and their constituent variables.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a list of its variables, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This allows for precise data serialization and deserialization.
*   **Data Types:** A mix of fundamental data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ types are used, indicating the underlying programming language and libraries used in Noita's development.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are generally descriptive, hinting at their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`).
*   **String Representation:** The `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` type is frequently used for string data, such as animation names or entity file paths.
*   **Vector Types:** `ceng::math::CVector2<int>` is used for 2D integer vectors, likely for positions or dimensions.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This section defines variables related to an AI's attack capabilities. It includes parameters like the probability of using an attack, the effective range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), the angular cone of attack (`angular_range_deg`), the name of the attack animation, and the entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks.

**2. `AIComponent` Variables (partial):**

```xml
    <Var name="hide_from_prey_time" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="food_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="pee_velocity_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet shows variables for a general `AIComponent`. It includes parameters related to AI behavior like hiding from prey, what materials constitute food, and even physical properties like the velocity of "pee" for certain entities.

**3. `InventoryComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="InventoryComponent" >

    <Var name="ui_container_type" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="ui_container_size" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<int>" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="ui_element_sprite" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="actions" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This component defines properties related to an entity's inventory and its user interface representation. It includes variables for the type and size of the inventory container, the sprite used for inventory elements, and associated actions.
