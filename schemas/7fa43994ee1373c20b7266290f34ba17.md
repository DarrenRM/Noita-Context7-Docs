# 7fa43994ee1373c20b7266290f34ba17

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. These components represent different functionalities and behaviors that can be attached to game entities, such as enemies, items, or environmental objects. Essentially, this file acts as a schema, outlining the data fields and their types for each type of component, allowing the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize these components. It's a fundamental part of how Noita's entities are defined and how their logic is implemented.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains all the `<Component>` definitions.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies the type of component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ItemComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define the individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes. This can give an indication of the data type.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can be primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, or more complex types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `struct types::aabb` (likely an axis-aligned bounding box).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their purpose is to define the schema rather than hold specific values.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly demonstrates a component-based design, where game entities are composed of various functional units (components).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, each with a name, size, and type. This provides a structured way to define the data associated with each component.
*   **Data Type Representation:** The `type` attribute uses C++-like syntax for primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and standard library types (`std::basic_string`). This suggests the underlying game engine is likely C++ based.
*   **Enum Types:** Some variables, like `type` in `ArcComponent`, are defined as `enum` types, indicating that they can only take on a predefined set of values.
*   **Struct Types:** Complex data structures are represented using `struct`, such as `struct LensValue<float>` and `struct types::aabb`.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_shooting_ok_angle_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability, range, cooldowns (`state_duration_frames`, `frames_between`), animation names, and specific properties for ranged attacks like the entity to spawn, count, and aiming behavior.

**2. `ItemComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="ItemComponent" >
    <Var name="item_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_stackable" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_consumable" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="auto_pickup" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="permanently_attached" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="uses_remaining" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_identified" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_frozen" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines properties for items in the game. It specifies the item's name, whether it can be stacked, if it's consumable, if it's automatically picked up, if it's permanently attached to something, its remaining uses, and its identification/frozen status.

**3. `MagicXRayComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="MagicXRayComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="steps_per_frame" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="mStep" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="mRadius" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component likely governs the behavior of "X-Ray" magic effects. It defines parameters such as the radius of the effect, the number of steps taken per frame for its calculation, and potentially internal step and radius values.
