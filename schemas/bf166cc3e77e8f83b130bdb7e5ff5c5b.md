# bf166cc3e77e8f83b130bdb7e5ff5c5b

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components and entities within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types, sizes, and names of variables that make up different game elements. This allows the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and manage the behavior and attributes of everything from enemy AI to physical properties of objects. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is organized.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` (representing a 2D vector of floats).

The structure is hierarchical: the root `<Schema>` element contains multiple `<Component>` elements, and each `<Component>` contains multiple `<Var>` elements.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="ComponentName">
    <Var name="variable_name_1" size="..." type="..." />
    <Var name="variable_name_2" size="..." type="..." />
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="AnotherComponentName">
    <Var name="another_variable" size="..." type="..." />
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game appears to use a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file defines the data associated with each of these components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** The `<Var>` tags are the core of the schema, detailing the specific data points for each component.
*   **Data Types:** A mix of fundamental C++ data types and custom engine types (like `CVector2`) are used, indicating the underlying programming language and engine.
*   **String Representation:** Strings are consistently represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Vector Representation:** 2D vectors are represented using `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`.
*   **Boolean Representation:** Booleans are represented with `size="1"` and `type="bool"`.
*   **Scripting Hooks:** Several components, particularly those related to AI and entity behavior, include variables that appear to be string paths to script files (e.g., `script_item_picked_up`, `script_death`). These likely allow for custom scripting to trigger on specific game events.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. AIAttackComponent:**
This component seems to define the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
*   `use_probability`: Likely controls how often this attack is chosen.
*   `min_distance`, `max_distance`, `angular_range_deg`: Define the spatial parameters for the attack.
*   `animation_name`: Specifies the animation to play when attacking.
*   `attack_ranged_entity_file`: Points to the entity (e.g., projectile) to be spawned for a ranged attack.
*   `attack_ranged_entity_count_min`: Minimum number of projectiles to spawn.

**2. AIComponent (partial sample):**
This component appears to define general AI behaviors and properties.

```xml
<Component component_name="AIComponent" >
  <Var name="ground_check_offset" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="eat_ground_radius" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="eat_ground" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="hitbox_radius" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="hunt_box_radius" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
*   `ground_check_offset`: Likely an offset for ground detection.
*   `eat_ground_radius`, `eat_ground`: Suggests a behavior where the AI can consume or interact with the ground.
*   `hitbox_radius`: Defines the AI's collision radius.
*   `hunt_box_radius`: The area within which the AI will actively hunt for targets.

**3. IKLimbWalkerComponent (partial sample):**
This component seems to be related to inverse kinematics (IK) for characters with limbs that walk on the ground.

```xml
<Component component_name="IKLimbWalkerComponent" >
  <Var name="ground_attachment_min_spread" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="ground_attachment_max_tries" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="ground_attachment_ray_length_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="leg_velocity_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="mTarget" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```
*   `ground_attachment_min_spread`, `ground_attachment_max_tries`, `ground_attachment_ray_length_coeff`: Parameters for how the IK system attaches limbs to the ground.
*   `leg_velocity_coeff`: A coefficient affecting leg movement speed.
*   `mTarget`: The target position for the limb, represented as a 2D vector.
