# 456f99c72639e948daa4bdab5cf5b3b8

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with different game entities and mechanics. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and utilize the data for entities like enemies, spells, and environmental effects. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is organized and what attributes each piece of data can have.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. These components are identified by a `component_name` attribute. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables.

Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `radius`, `material`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types such as `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) and `class std::vector<...>` (representing a dynamic array).

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Component>` elements containing `<Var>` elements. The root element of the XML is `<Schema>`, which contains the `hash` attribute, likely a unique identifier for this schema definition.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's data is organized around reusable components, each responsible for a specific aspect of an entity's behavior or properties (e.g., AI, attacks, visual effects, physics).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This allows for precise control over the data associated with each component.
*   **String Representation:** C++ string types are represented using a verbose `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Vector Representation:** C++ vectors are represented using a similarly verbose `class std::vector<...>` type.
*   **Attack Components:** Several components appear to be related to AI and combat, defining parameters for attacks (melee, ranged, dash), distances, damage, and animations.
*   **Visual and Environmental Components:** Components like `FogOfWarRemoverComponent`, `FossilComponent`, and `GameAreaEffectComponent` suggest definitions for visual effects, environmental generation, and area-based game mechanics.
*   **Physics and Rendering:** Variables like `b2_force` and attributes related to images and animations indicate definitions for physics interactions and visual rendering.

## Sample Entries

**1. AIAttackComponent:**
This component defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities.
```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    </Component>
```
This sample shows variables for attack probability, range, angular targeting, animation names, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

**2. FogOfWarRemoverComponent:**
This component likely defines how certain entities or effects clear the fog of war.
```xml
  <Component component_name="FogOfWarRemoverComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
It contains a single variable, `radius`, which is a float, indicating the area of effect for clearing the fog.

**3. FossilComponent:**
This component seems to be related to the generation or properties of fossils within the game.
```xml
  <Component component_name="FossilComponent" >
    <Var name="count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="material" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="image_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
It defines minimum and maximum counts, the material type, and an image file associated with the fossil.
