# ed29860d59fdd84ca4086cbb7faf799c

This XML file, identified by the hash `ed29860d59fdd84ca4086cbb7faf799c`, defines a collection of game components and their associated variables within the Noita game data. These components are fundamental building blocks for various game entities, dictating their behavior, properties, and interactions. This schema file essentially acts as a blueprint for how different parts of the game world are constructed and function, from enemy AI and character physics to environmental effects and spawning mechanics. Understanding this file is crucial for comprehending the underlying logic of Noita's gameplay and for modding purposes.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. These `<Component>` elements are enclosed within a root `<Schema>` tag.

Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that clearly identifies its purpose (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `CharacterPlatformingComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The specific name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `eff_hg_size_x`).
*   **`size`**: The memory size allocated for this variable, often in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `struct LensValue<float>`, `class ConfigExplosion`, `enum EXPLOSION_TRIGGER_TYPE::Enum`). This indicates how the data is stored and interpreted.

The content within a `<Var>` tag is typically empty, as the actual values for these variables are defined elsewhere in the game's data, likely in entity-specific configuration files that reference these schema definitions.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns emerge from the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design**: The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where distinct functionalities are encapsulated into reusable components.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component is defined by a set of variables, specifying its configurable parameters.
*   **Data Types**: A variety of data types are used, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ class/struct types (e.g., `std::basic_string`, `LensValue`, `ConfigExplosion`, `CVector2`). This suggests a sophisticated underlying game engine.
*   **AI and Behavior**: Components like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` indicate a focus on defining enemy and NPC behaviors, including attack patterns, movement, and decision-making.
*   **Physics and Movement**: Components such as `CharacterPlatformingComponent` and variables related to velocity and physics suggest detailed control over character and object movement.
*   **Environmental Effects**: Components like `ExplosionComponent` and `MaterialSeaSpawnerComponent` point to the definition of environmental hazards, effects, and material generation.
*   **String Representation**: The frequent use of `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for string types indicates that many parameters, such as animation names or entity file paths, are defined as strings.
*   **Complex Structures**: The presence of types like `struct LensValue<float>` and `class ConfigExplosion` suggests that some variables are complex data structures themselves, likely containing further nested properties.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for the probability of using an attack, the range (minimum and maximum distance, angular range), the animation to play during the attack, and the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks.

**2. `CharacterPlatformingComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="CharacterPlatformingComponent" >

    <Var name="velocity_min_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >

    </Var>

    <Var name="velocity_max_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
```

This component likely governs how characters move and interact with platforms. The `velocity_min_x` and `velocity_max_x` variables, defined as `struct LensValue<float>`, suggest that character horizontal velocity can be dynamically adjusted or have a range of possible values, possibly influenced by game state or other factors.

**3. `ExplosionComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="ExplosionComponent" >

    <Var name="trigger" size="4" type="enum EXPLOSION_TRIGGER_TYPE::Enum" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="config_explosion" size="364" type="class ConfigExplosion" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="timeout_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="kill_entity" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```

This component defines the properties of explosions. It includes a `trigger` type (likely specifying when the explosion occurs), a `config_explosion` which is a complex structure holding detailed explosion parameters, a `timeout_frames` to control its duration, and a `kill_entity` flag to determine if the explosion should destroy the entity that caused it.
