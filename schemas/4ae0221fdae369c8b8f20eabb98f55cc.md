# 4ae0221fdae369c8b8f20eabb98f55cc

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their properties within Noita. It acts as a blueprint for how different game entities (like enemies, player abilities, environmental objects) are structured and configured. By defining these components and their variables, the game engine knows how to load, interpret, and utilize these elements to create the game's behavior, physics, and visual effects. This file is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanics of Noita and is a primary reference for modders.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the type of component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ControlsComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `enabled`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum`).

The structure is hierarchical: the schema contains components, and components contain variables.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game logic and data are organized into modular components.
*   **Variable Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex types like strings (`class std::basic_string...`) and enums (`enum ...::Enum`). Custom class types are also referenced (e.g., `class ConfigDrugFx`).
*   **AI and Physics Focus:** Many components appear to relate to Artificial Intelligence (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and physics (`PhysicsJoint2MutatorComponent`, `ElectricChargeComponent`).
*   **Configuration Data:** The variables often represent configurable parameters for these components, such as probabilities, distances, durations, animation names, and physical properties.
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many `bool` variables are used as flags to enable or disable specific behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_enabled`, `gamepad_indirect_aiming_enabled`, `break_on_body_modified`).

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component likely defines the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes settings for attack range, probability of use, and specific properties for ranged attacks, such as the entity file to spawn and whether to use a laser sight.

2.  **`ControlsComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ControlsComponent" >
      <Var name="polymorph_hax" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="gamepad_indirect_aiming_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="gamepad_fire_on_thumbstick_extend" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component seems to govern player input and control schemes. It includes boolean flags for enabling various control features, such as indirect aiming with a gamepad or firing based on thumbstick extension.

3.  **`PhysicsJoint2MutatorComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PhysicsJoint2MutatorComponent" >
      <Var name="break_force" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="break_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="break_on_body_modified" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="type" size="4" type="enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="body1_id" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="body2_id" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component appears to define properties for physics joints, specifically those that can be "mutated" or broken. It includes parameters for break force and distance, a flag to break on body modification, the type of joint, and identifiers for the two bodies it connects.
