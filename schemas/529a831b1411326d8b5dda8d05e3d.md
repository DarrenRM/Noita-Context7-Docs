# 529a831b1411326d8b5dda8d05e3d

This XML file defines a schema for game data within Noita, specifically related to the configuration and behavior of various game entities and systems. It acts as a blueprint or template, outlining the structure and types of data that can be associated with different game components. This schema is crucial for the game's engine to correctly interpret and utilize data files that conform to this structure, enabling the creation of diverse enemies, items, environmental effects, and AI behaviors.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document with a root `<Schema>` element. Inside this root, various `<Component>` elements are defined. Each `<Component>` represents a distinct functional part of a game entity or system and has a `component_name` attribute to identify it.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual data variables that belong to that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `velocity_x`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the data in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `struct LensValue<float>`, `struct ValueRangeInt`).

The `type` attribute can sometimes include more complex C++ type names, indicating structures or class instances used internally by the game engine.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The schema clearly follows a component-based design, where functionality is broken down into modular components. This is evident from the `<Component>` tags, each with a descriptive `component_name`.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component is further detailed by `<Var>` tags, specifying the exact data fields it uses.
*   **Data Type Specificity**: The `type` attribute in `<Var>` tags is quite specific, ranging from primitive types like `int`, `float`, and `bool` to more complex C++ types like `std::basic_string` (for text) and custom structs like `LensValue<float>` and `ValueRangeInt`. This suggests a highly structured and type-safe data system.
*   **AI and Behavior Focus**: Many component names, such as `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, and `CharacterPlatformingComponent`, indicate a strong focus on defining artificial intelligence, enemy behaviors, and character movement mechanics.
*   **Entity Loading and Management**: Components like `LoadEntitiesComponent` suggest mechanisms for dynamically loading and managing game entities within the game world.
*   **Physical Properties**: Variables related to velocity, distance, radius, and forces (`velocity_min_x`, `max_distance`, `radius`, `eff_hg_b2force_multiplier`) point to the definition of physical properties for game objects.

## Sample Entries

### AIAttackComponent

This component appears to define parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities, particularly ranged attacks.

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This sample shows variables controlling attack range, timing, animation, and the properties of projectiles or spawned entities for ranged attacks.

### CharacterPlatformingComponent

This component seems to define the physics and movement parameters for characters, focusing on platforming abilities.

```xml
<Component component_name="CharacterPlatformingComponent" >
  <Var name="velocity_min_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="velocity_max_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="velocity_min_y" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="velocity_max_y" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="run_velocity" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="fly_velocity_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

The use of `struct LensValue<float>` suggests that velocity parameters might be dynamic or have a range of values, potentially influenced by game state or other factors.

### LoadEntitiesComponent

This component appears to be responsible for defining how and when other game entities are loaded or spawned.

```xml
<Component component_name="LoadEntitiesComponent" >
  <Var name="entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="count" size="8" type="struct ValueRangeInt" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="kill_entity" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="timeout_frames" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This indicates that entities can be spawned based on a specified file, a range of counts, and can be configured to be killed after a certain duration or condition.
