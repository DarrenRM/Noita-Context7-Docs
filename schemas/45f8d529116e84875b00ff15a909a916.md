# 45f8d529116e84875b00ff15a909a916

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. These components dictate the behavior, attributes, and functionalities of entities within the game, such as enemies, items, and environmental elements. Essentially, this file acts as a blueprint for how different parts of the game world operate and interact.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. Each `<Var>` element defines a specific variable or property associated with that component.

The general structure is as follows:

```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
      <!-- Optional content, often empty for basic types -->
    </Var>
    <!-- ... more Var elements ... -->
  </Component>
  <!-- ... more Component elements ... -->
</Schema>
```

Key attributes observed for `<Var>` elements include:
*   `name`: The identifier for the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` for 2D vectors).

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's logic is heavily reliant on a component-based system. Each `<Component>` tag groups related variables that define a specific functionality (e.g., AI behavior, attack mechanics, visual properties).
*   **Variable Definitions:** The `<Var>` tags are the core of the data. They specify the name, size, and type of each configurable parameter for a component.
*   **String Representation:** String data types are represented by a complex class name, indicating they are likely managed strings within the game's engine.
*   **Numerical Types:** Common numerical types like `int` and `float` are used extensively for parameters such as distances, speeds, durations, and probabilities.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors.
*   **Vector Types:** Custom vector types, like `ceng::math::CVector2<float>`, are used for representing positional or directional data.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
This component appears to define the parameters for an AI's attacking behavior.

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
These variables suggest an AI can have a probability of attacking, define attack ranges (minimum and maximum distance), specify an animation to play during an attack, and even define the entity file to be used for ranged attacks.

**2. `AIComponent` Variables:**
This component seems to hold general AI-related properties, including item usage and inventory management.

```xml
    <Var name="item_recoil_rotation_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="base_item_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="shooting_reduces_amount_in_inventory" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="throw_as_item" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_amount_in_inventory" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
```
This shows parameters related to recoil when using items, the base item file associated with the AI, whether shooting consumes inventory items, if an item can be thrown, and the maximum stack size for items in the inventory.

**3. `HotspotComponent` Variables:**
This component likely defines visual anchor points or offsets for sprites.

```xml
  <Component component_name="HotspotComponent" >

    <Var name="offset" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="sprite_hotspot_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
The `offset` variable, a 2D vector, and `sprite_hotspot_name`, a string, suggest this component is used to define specific points on a sprite for alignment or interaction purposes.
