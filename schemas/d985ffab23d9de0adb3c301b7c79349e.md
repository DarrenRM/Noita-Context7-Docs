# d985ffab23d9de0adb3c301b7c79349e

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their properties within Noita. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the structure and data types for different aspects of game entities, such as AI behaviors, abilities, and particle effects. By defining these components and their variables, the game engine knows how to interpret and utilize the data associated with each element, enabling complex interactions and behaviors. This file is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanics of Noita and is a primary reference for modders looking to alter or create new game content.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct functional part of a game entity. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` for 2D vectors).

The structure is hierarchical, with the root element being `<Schema>` which contains all the `<Component>` definitions.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's data is organized around distinct components, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. This modular approach allows for flexible combination of behaviors.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This provides a clear contract for how data should be structured.
*   **String Representation:** String data types are represented using a verbose C++-like class name (`class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`), indicating the underlying implementation.
*   **Numerical Types:** Common numerical types like `int` and `float` are used extensively for values like probabilities, distances, durations, and energy levels.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_enabled`, `emit_cosmetic_particles`).
*   **Vector Types:** For spatial data, vector types like `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` are used to represent positions or offsets.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. AIAttackComponent:**
This component defines the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables controlling attack range, angles, animation, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

**2. AbilityComponent:**
This component defines the properties of a character's or item's abilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AbilityComponent" >
    <Var name="cooldown_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="sprite_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="mana" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="mana_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows variables related to ability cooldowns, associated entity and sprite files, and mana costs/capacity.

**3. ElectricityComponent:**
This component likely governs the behavior and properties of electrical effects or entities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="ElectricityComponent" >
    <Var name="energy" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="probability_to_heat" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="speed" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="splittings_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="splittings_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="hack_is_material_crack" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample includes variables for energy, heat probability, speed, and splitting behavior, along with boolean flags for special electrical effects.
