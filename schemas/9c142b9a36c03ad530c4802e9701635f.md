# 9c142b9a36c03ad530c4802e9701635f

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables in Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different game entities and their behaviors. This is crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and manage the properties of objects, enemies, spells, and other game elements. By defining these components and their variables, the game can ensure consistency and proper functionality across its vast array of in-game elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `BookComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `speed`, `is_weapon`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>` (representing a 2D vector of integers).

The structure is hierarchical, with components containing variables. The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their definition is provided by the attributes.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's logic and properties are organized into modular components, each responsible for a specific aspect of an entity's behavior or attributes.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, detailing its configurable parameters.
*   **Data Type Variety:** A range of data types are used, from simple booleans and integers to floating-point numbers and complex string and vector types, allowing for nuanced control over game mechanics.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are generally descriptive, indicating their purpose (e.g., `min_distance`, `speed_hunt`, `eating_probability`).
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are booleans (`type="bool"`) used to enable or disable specific features or states (e.g., `is_weapon`, `center_camera_on_this_entity`).
*   **Numerical Parameters:** Integers and floats are used extensively for numerical values such as speeds, distances, probabilities, and durations.
*   **String Identifiers:** String types are used for names, animations, or entity files.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component likely defines the parameters for an AI's attacking behavior. It includes variables for attack probability, range, animation names, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

2.  **`BossDragonComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="BossDragonComponent" >
      <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="speed_hunt" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="gravity" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component appears to define attributes specific to a "Boss Dragon" entity, such as its movement speed, hunting speed, and how gravity affects it.

3.  **`ItemAlchemyComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ItemAlchemyComponent" >
      <Var name="material_make_always_cast" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="material_remove_shuffle" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component seems to relate to alchemy mechanics, with variables controlling how materials are made or removed, possibly related to spell crafting or potion brewing.
