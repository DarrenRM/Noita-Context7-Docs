# 58b621e7764460c8d46c87668ff1689f

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. These components dictate the behavior, appearance, and interactions of entities in the game, such as creatures, items, and environmental objects. Essentially, this file acts as a blueprint for how different parts of the game world are configured and function. It's a crucial part of the game's data that modders would heavily reference to understand and alter game mechanics.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Within each component, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The structure is hierarchical:
```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="...">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's data is organized around distinct components, each responsible for a specific aspect of an entity's functionality (e.g., AI, physics, attacks, item properties).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's behavior is defined by a set of variables, specified using the `<Var>` tag. These variables control parameters like probabilities, distances, durations, animations, and entity spawning.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings (represented by `class std::basic_string<...>`).
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`, `item_count_min`).
*   **Component Grouping:** Components appear to be grouped logically. For instance, AI-related components like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` are defined. Similarly, physics-related components like `PhysicsRagdollComponent` and `PhysicsShapeComponent` are present.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component defines the parameters for an AI's attack behavior.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows how an AI can be configured to attack, including its range, angles, animation, and the specific entity (like a projectile) it uses for ranged attacks.

2.  **`AIComponent`**: This component seems to define broader AI behaviors and decision-making.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
      <Var name="escape_if_damaged_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_if_damaged_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="creature_detection_range_x" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance_to_cam_to_start_hunting" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This illustrates AI logic for reacting to damage, detecting other creatures, and deciding when to initiate hunting behavior based on proximity to the camera.

3.  **`ItemChestComponent`**: This component defines the properties of chests that contain items.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ItemChestComponent" >
      <Var name="item_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="item_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="level" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="enemy_drop" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="actions" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows how chests are configured to spawn a certain number of items, their level, whether they are an enemy drop, and any associated actions.
