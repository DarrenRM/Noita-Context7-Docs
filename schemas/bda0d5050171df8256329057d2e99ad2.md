# bda0d5050171df8256329057d2e99ad2

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data fields and their types for different game entities and systems. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and manage the behavior and attributes of in-game elements, such as AI, physics, visual effects, and more. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how different parts of the game are configured.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the type of component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `GhostComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `speed`, `mana_current`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, `double`, or more complex types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` (representing a 2D vector of floats).

The structure is hierarchical: a `<Schema>` contains multiple `<Component>`s, and each `<Component>` contains multiple `<Var>`s.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components. This allows for modularity and reusability of game logic.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each `<Var>` element specifies the exact data type and size, indicating how the game engine should interpret and store this data.
*   **String Representation:** String data types are consistently represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Vector Representation:** 2D vector data is represented using `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` or `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>`.
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are booleans (`type="bool"`) used as flags to enable or disable specific behaviors (e.g., `attack_landing_ranged_enabled`, `create_ragdoll`, `die_if_no_home`).
*   **Numerical Parameters:** A significant number of variables are numerical (`int`, `float`, `double`) used for controlling values like probabilities, distances, speeds, durations, and quantities.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This section defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities. It includes settings for attack probability, range, targeting angles, animation names, and the entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks.

2.  **`GhostComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="GhostComponent" >
      <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="velocity" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="aggressiveness" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="target_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component likely governs the behavior of "ghost" entities. It defines their movement speed, current velocity, aggressiveness level, and the type of target they are programmed to pursue (indicated by `target_tag`).

3.  **`MaterialSeaSpawnerComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="MaterialSeaSpawnerComponent" >
      <Var name="material" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="size" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<int>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="offset" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<int>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="speed" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component appears to be responsible for spawning "material seas" or areas of specific materials. It defines the type of material to spawn (`material`), the dimensions of the area (`size`), its position relative to an origin (`offset`), and the speed at which it might spread or form.
