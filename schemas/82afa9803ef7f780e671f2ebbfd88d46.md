# 82afa9803ef7f780e671f2ebbfd88d46

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types, sizes, and names of variables that make up different game entities and their behaviors. This file is crucial for understanding how game objects are configured and how their attributes are stored and interpreted by the game engine. It's essentially a blueprint for the data that defines the game's world, characters, items, and mechanics.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. These components are identified by a `component_name` attribute. Within each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements, each defining a specific variable or property associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `radius`, `lifetime`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the underlying data type.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. Common types include `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `struct ValueRange`.

The structure is hierarchical: the root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements.

```xml
<Schema hash="82afa9803ef7f780e671f2ebbfd88d46" >
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <!-- ... other variables ... -->
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    <!-- ... variables for AIComponent ... -->
  </Component>
  <!-- ... other components ... -->
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities (AI, physics, lighting, etc.) are encapsulated in distinct components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, each with a name, size, and type. This allows for granular control over game object properties.
*   **Data Type Representation:** The `type` attribute uses C++-like naming conventions, indicating the underlying implementation. Strings are represented by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, and simple types like integers and floats are explicitly named.
*   **Categorization of Components:** Components appear to be grouped by their functional area, such as AI-related components (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`), physics (`PhysicsShapeComponent`), visual effects (`LightComponent`), and lifecycle management (`LifetimeComponent`).
*   **String Handling:** String variables, often used for filenames or identifiers, consistently use the `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` type.
*   **Numerical Ranges:** Some variables, like `randomize_lifetime`, are indicated as `struct ValueRange`, suggesting they define a minimum and maximum value.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This section defines parameters for an AI's attack behavior. Variables like `use_probability`, `min_distance`, and `max_distance` control when and how an AI attacks. `animation_name` likely specifies the animation to play during an attack.

2.  **`LifetimeComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="LifetimeComponent" >
      <Var name="lifetime" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="randomize_lifetime" size="8" type="struct ValueRange" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="fade_sprites" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component manages the lifespan of game entities. `lifetime` sets a fixed duration, while `randomize_lifetime` suggests a range for variability. `fade_sprites` indicates whether the entity's sprites should fade out over time.

3.  **`LightComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="LightComponent" >
      <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="r" size="4" type="unsigned int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="g" size="4" type="unsigned int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="b" size="4" type="unsigned int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="offset_x" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="offset_y" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines the properties of a light source. `radius` controls its range, and `r`, `g`, `b` define its color (likely in RGB format). `offset_x` and `offset_y` specify the light's position relative to its parent entity.
