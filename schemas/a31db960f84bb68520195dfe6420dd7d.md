# a31db960f84bb68520195dfe6420dd7d

This XML file defines various game components and their associated variables, serving as a schema for how these components are structured and what data they hold. These components are fundamental building blocks for entities within the game Noita, dictating their behavior, properties, and interactions. By defining these components, the game can systematically construct and manage everything from enemy AI and projectile behavior to environmental effects and visual elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables or properties associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, or complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, or custom classes like `class ConfigDrugFx`).

The structure is hierarchical, with the root element being `<Schema>` which contains all the `<Component>` definitions.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This allows for granular control over component behavior.
*   **Data Types:** A mix of fundamental C++ data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ class types are used, indicating the underlying programming language and object model. String types are often represented by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **AI and Behavior:** Several components appear to be related to Artificial Intelligence and entity behavior, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`, suggesting parameters for movement, targeting, and actions.
*   **Physical Properties:** Components like `DieIfSpeedBelowComponent` and variables related to speed and position indicate definitions for physical characteristics and interactions.
*   **Visual and Effect Components:** Components like `PixelSceneComponent` and variables related to effects (`effect_hit_ground`, `drug_fx_target`) suggest definitions for visual aspects and special effects.

## Sample Entries

### AIAttackComponent

This component defines parameters related to an entity's attacking capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables controlling attack probability, range, aiming angles, animation states, and parameters for ranged attacks, including the entity file to spawn, count limits, and whether to use a laser sight.

### DrugEffectComponent and DrugEffectModifierComponent

These components seem to manage the effects of "drugs" or special status effects on entities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="DrugEffectComponent" >
    <Var name="drug_fx_target" size="28" type="class ConfigDrugFx" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="m_drug_fx_current" size="28" type="class ConfigDrugFx" >
    </Var>
  </Component>

  <Component component_name="DrugEffectModifierComponent" >
    <Var name="fx_add" size="28" type="class ConfigDrugFx" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="fx_multiply" size="28" type="class ConfigDrugFx" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
`DrugEffectComponent` likely holds the current drug effects applied to an entity, while `DrugEffectModifierComponent` appears to define how these effects can be modified (added to or multiplied). The `class ConfigDrugFx` suggests a complex structure for defining these effects.

### PixelSceneComponent

This component is responsible for defining visual elements and scene properties.

```xml
  <Component component_name="PixelSceneComponent" >
    <Var name="pixel_scene" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="pixel_scene_visual" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="pixel_scene_background" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="background_z_index" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="offset_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="offset_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="skip_biome_checks" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component defines which "pixel scenes" (likely pre-defined visual assets or tilemaps) are used for an entity, including foreground, background, their Z-ordering, and positional offsets. It also includes flags to control biome-specific logic.
