# 1471271fcc670ca5b0e5ab1e0095bc15

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within Noita. It acts as a blueprint for how different entities and systems in the game are structured and configured. By defining these components and their properties, the game engine can correctly load, interpret, and utilize data for entities, behaviors, and game mechanics. This file is crucial for understanding the underlying data structures that govern Noita's gameplay.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. These components are identified by a `component_name` attribute. Within each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables or properties of that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`).

The structure can be visualized as:

```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="...">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where functionality is broken down into modular components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, detailing its configurable parameters.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types like integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and booleans (`bool`), as well as more complex types like strings (represented by `class std::basic_string<...>`).
*   **AI and Behavior:** Several components appear to be related to Artificial Intelligence and entity behavior, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`. These components define parameters for actions, movement, and decision-making.
*   **Physical Properties:** Components like `LiquidDisplacerComponent` suggest definitions for physical interactions, such as how liquids behave and displace.
*   **Entity Management:** Components like `LoadEntitiesComponent` indicate mechanisms for spawning or managing other game entities.
*   **Pathfinding:** The `PathFindingComponent` defines parameters related to how entities navigate the game world.

## Sample Entries

### `AIAttackComponent`

This component defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack range, timing, animation, and projectile properties.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows how attack parameters like `min_distance`, `max_distance`, `angular_range_deg`, and the name of the attack animation (`animation_name`) are defined. It also details how ranged attacks are configured, including the entity file for projectiles (`attack_ranged_entity_file`) and the number of projectiles to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_count_min`, `attack_ranged_entity_count_max`).

### `AIComponent` (Partial Sample)

This component appears to be a more general AI controller, with variables related to environmental interactions and damage.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    <Var name="falling_damages" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="falling_damage_height_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="falling_damage_damage_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="air_needed" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="air_in_lungs" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="air_lack_of_damage" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="materials_damage" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="material_damage_min_cell_count" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This snippet illustrates variables that control how an entity reacts to falling (`falling_damages`, `falling_damage_height_min`, `falling_damage_damage_min`), its need for air (`air_needed`, `air_in_lungs`), and how it might be affected by or damage certain materials (`materials_damage`, `material_damage_min_cell_count`).

### `LiquidDisplacerComponent`

This component defines properties for entities that interact with and displace liquids.

```xml
  <Component component_name="LiquidDisplacerComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="velocity_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="velocity_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows how the `radius` of the displacement effect and its `velocity` in the x and y directions are defined, suggesting how an entity might push or interact with fluid elements in the game world.
