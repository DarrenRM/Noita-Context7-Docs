# 01d04604e1a3996d7da7eb12bc8506e4

This XML file defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the structure and types of data that can be associated with different game entities. Essentially, it describes the properties and attributes that make up the behavior and characteristics of objects, characters, and systems within the game. This schema is crucial for the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data associated with each component.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document with a root `<Schema>` element. Inside this root element, various `<Component>` elements are defined. Each `<Component>` represents a distinct type of game logic or data container.

Within each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties that belong to that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The identifier for the variable.
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `class ConfigGun`, etc.). The `class std::basic_string` type indicates a string, while other `class` types likely refer to custom game data structures.

The structure is hierarchical: `Schema` contains `Component`s, and `Component`s contain `Var`s.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The file clearly follows a component-based design, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `GameLogComponent`, `GameStatsComponent`).
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying their name, size, and data type.
*   **Data Type Variety**: A range of data types are used, including fundamental types like integers, floats, and booleans, as well as more complex types like strings and custom class structures (e.g., `ConfigGun`, `ConfigGunActionInfo`).
*   **Naming Conventions**: Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`, `report_death`).
*   **Boolean Flags**: Many variables are booleans (`size="1" type="bool"`), used to enable or disable specific behaviors or states (e.g., `attack_landing_ranged_enabled`, `drop_as_item_on_death`, `mInvisible`).
*   **Numerical Parameters**: Integers and floats are used for numerical values like distances, durations, counts, and speeds.
*   **String Properties**: String types are used for names, file paths, and animation identifiers.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This section defines parameters related to an AI's attacking behavior. It includes variables for attack probability, range, aiming angles, animation names, and details about ranged attacks such as the entity file to spawn and the minimum count of entities.

**2. `AIComponent` (partial) Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="shooting_reduces_amount_in_inventory" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="throw_as_item" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_amount_in_inventory" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="amount_in_inventory" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="drop_as_item_on_death" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="ui_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="gun_config" size="20" type="class ConfigGun" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="gunaction_config" size="544" type="class ConfigGunActionInfo" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet from the `AIComponent` (likely related to entities that can use weapons) defines properties like whether shooting reduces inventory amounts, if an item can be thrown, inventory limits, and configuration pointers for guns and their actions.

**3. `GameLogComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="GameLogComponent" >
    <Var name="report_death" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="report_damage" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="report_new_biomes" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="mVisitiedBiomes" size="12" type="class std::vector<class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >,class std::allocator<class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> > > >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component is responsible for logging game events. It includes boolean flags to enable reporting of deaths, damage, and new biome discoveries, as well as a variable to store a list of visited biomes.
