# fe5f1bb8b106645d1f9d93eb34b98125

This XML file, identified by the hash `fe5f1bb8b106645d1f9d93eb34b98125`, defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint, outlining the structure and data types for different aspects of game entities, such as AI behaviors, audio properties, and physics interactions. This schema file is crucial for the game's engine to correctly interpret and instantiate these components when loading game data, ensuring that entities behave as intended.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute specifying its identifier.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The structure is hierarchical: `<Schema>` contains `<Component>`s, and `<Component>`s contain `<Var>`s.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="...">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's entities are built using a modular, component-based architecture. This file defines the available components and their properties.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** Each variable has a clearly defined `type` and `size`, indicating how the data is stored and interpreted by the game engine. Common types include integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings (represented by `class std::basic_string...`).
*   **AI and Behavior Definitions:** Components like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` suggest that this file plays a significant role in defining enemy and NPC behaviors, including attack patterns, movement, and decision-making.
*   **Audio and Visual Properties:** Components like `AudioComponent` and `AudioLoopComponent` indicate definitions for sound playback, while other components (not fully sampled but implied by context) would likely cover visual aspects.
*   **Physics and Interaction:** Components like `PhysicsPickUpComponent` and the presence of physics-related variables within other components point to the definition of how objects interact physically within the game world.
*   **Material Properties:** The presence of variables like `material_animate_wand` and `material_increase_uses_remaining` within a component (likely related to items or wands) suggests definitions for how different materials or magical effects behave.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows how an AI's attack range, probability of use, associated animations, and the entity file for ranged attacks are defined.

2.  **`AudioComponent`:**
    This component defines properties for sound playback.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AudioComponent" >
      <Var name="file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="event_root" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="set_latest_event_position" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This illustrates how sound files, event roots, and whether to set the latest event position are configured for audio.

3.  **`PhysicsPickUpComponent` (partial):**
    This component, though only partially sampled, likely relates to objects that can be picked up. The presence of `breakable`, `type`, `body1_id`, `body2_id`, and physics-related `pos_x`, `pos_y`, `delta_x`, `delta_y`, `mMotorEnabled`, `mMotorSpeed`, `mMaxMotorTorque` suggests it's involved in defining the physical properties and constraints of such objects, possibly for joints or interactive elements.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PhysicsPickUpComponent" >
      ...
      <Var name="breakable" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="type" size="4" type="enum JOINT_TYPE::Enum" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="body1_id" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="body2_id" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="pos_x" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="delta_y" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mMotorEnabled" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
