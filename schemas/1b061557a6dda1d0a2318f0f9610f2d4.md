# 1b061557a6dda1d0a2318f0f9610f2d4

This XML file defines the structure and data types for various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining how different game entities and their properties are represented in the game's data files. These schemas are crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the game's behavior, as they dictate the parameters that can be set for entities like enemies, items, and player attributes.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct set of properties or behaviors that can be attached to game entities. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose.

Within each `<Component>`, individual properties are defined using `<Var>` tags. These `<Var>` tags have the following key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable or property.
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This often correlates with the data type.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. Common types include `int`, `float`, `bool`, and C++ string types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Component>` tags containing multiple `<Var>` tags.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="1b061557a6dda1d0a2318f0f9610f2d4" >
  <Component component_name="ComponentName" >
    <Var name="variable_name_1" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_2" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_3" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    </Component>
  </Component>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The game appears to use a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This schema file defines the properties for these components.
*   **AI and Behavior**: Several components relate to Artificial Intelligence (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`), defining parameters for enemy behavior, targeting, and movement.
*   **Entity Properties**: Components like `PlayerStatsComponent` and `BuildingUIComponent` define core attributes of entities, such as health, speed, and item properties.
*   **Data Type Representation**: The `type` attribute in `<Var>` tags clearly indicates how data is stored, with common C++ primitive types and string representations being prevalent.
*   **String Representation**: C++ string types are represented with a specific, lengthy `type` attribute, indicating their underlying implementation.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component defines parameters related to an entity's attack capabilities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows how an AI's attack can be configured with probabilities, ranges, and specific projectile or effect entity files.

2.  **`BuildingUIComponent`**: This component seems to define properties related to UI elements for buildings or interactive objects.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="BuildingUIComponent" >
      <Var name="building_type" size="4" type="enum BUILDINGUI_TYPE::Enum" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    The `building_type` variable suggests a categorization system for these UI elements.

3.  **`PlayerStatsComponent`**: This component defines fundamental player statistics.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PlayerStatsComponent" >
      <Var name="lives" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_hp" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This clearly shows how player health, lives, and movement speed are defined.
