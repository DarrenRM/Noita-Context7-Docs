# 283d0455249b51578adb3403337c56a4

This XML file defines the structure and data types for various game components and their properties within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining how different game elements, such as AI behaviors, item properties, and environmental reactions, are represented and configured. This schema is crucial for the game's engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data associated with these components, enabling the complex interactions and behaviors observed in the game.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the type of component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ItemAlchemyComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `material_make_always_cast`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `struct LensValue<int>` (likely a custom struct for handling values with potential variations).

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Var>` elements nested within their respective `<Component>` elements.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns emerge from the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's data is organized around distinct components, each responsible for a specific aspect of an entity's behavior or properties.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying their name, size, and data type. This allows for precise control over how data is stored and interpreted.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names often reflect their purpose, such as `attack_ranged_...` for ranged attack parameters, `material_...` for alchemy-related properties, and `item_...` for item characteristics.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, from simple integers and floats to strings and custom structs, indicating a flexible and detailed data representation system.
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are of type `bool`, used to enable or disable specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_use_message`, `clean_stains`, `loop`).
*   **Numerical Parameters:** Many variables are numerical (`int` or `float`) and likely control values like probabilities, distances, durations, counts, and temperatures.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. `use_probability` likely controls how often the AI attempts to attack, `min_distance` and `max_distance` define its engagement range, `animation_name` specifies the animation to play during an attack, and `attack_ranged_entity_file` points to the projectile or entity spawned during a ranged attack.

**2. `ItemAlchemyComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="ItemAlchemyComponent" >

    <Var name="material_make_always_cast" size="4" type="int" >

    </Var>

    <Var name="material_remove_shuffle" size="4" type="int" >

    </Var>

    <Var name="material_animate_wand" size="4" type="int" >

    </Var>
```

This component appears to define properties related to alchemy items. Variables like `material_make_always_cast`, `material_remove_shuffle`, and `material_animate_wand` suggest that these items can influence material transformations, potentially by always casting a spell, shuffling materials, or animating wands. The `int` type for these might represent specific flags or modes.

**3. `ItemChestComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="ItemChestComponent" >

    <Var name="item_count_min" size="4" type="int" >

    </Var>

    <Var name="item_count_max" size="4" type="int" >

    </Var>

    <Var name="level" size="4" type="int" >

    </Var>

    <Var name="enemy_drop" size="1" type="bool" >

    </Var>
```

This component defines properties for items that function as chests. `item_count_min` and `item_count_max` likely determine the range of items contained within the chest, `level` might indicate the difficulty or tier of the chest, and `enemy_drop` suggests whether enemies can drop this type of chest.
