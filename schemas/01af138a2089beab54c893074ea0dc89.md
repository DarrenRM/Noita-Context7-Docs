# 01af138a2089beab54c893074ea0dc89

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with different game mechanics and entities. This file is crucial for understanding how game objects are configured and how their behaviors are determined. It's essentially a blueprint for the data that defines the game's elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. The root element `<Schema>` contains these components and is identified by a `hash` attribute.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that clearly identifies the type of component it defines (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `EnergyShieldComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `radius`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are empty, indicating that this file defines the *structure* of the data, not its specific values.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly follows a component-based design pattern, where game entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Data Type Specification:** For each variable, the exact data type and size are specified, ensuring consistency and proper data handling.
*   **String Representation:** C++ standard library string types are explicitly named, indicating the underlying implementation details.
*   **Categorization of Components:** Components are grouped by their function, such as AI behaviors (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`), physical properties (`PhysicsShapeComponent`), or defensive mechanisms (`EnergyShieldComponent`).
*   **Boolean Flags:** Many variables are of type `bool`, used to enable or disable specific features or behaviors (e.g., `attack_ranged_enabled`, `recreate`, `is_circle`).
*   **Numerical Parameters:** A significant number of variables are `int` or `float`, used for numerical values like distances, speeds, probabilities, and durations.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows how an AI's attack can be configured with probabilities, ranges, animation names, and the specific entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks.

**2. `EnergyShieldComponent`:**
This component details the properties of an energy shield.

```xml
  <Component component_name="EnergyShieldComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_multiplier" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_energy" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="energy_required_to_shield" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="recharge_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This demonstrates how shield parameters like its size, effectiveness against damage, energy capacity, and recharge rate are defined.

**3. `PhysicsShapeComponent`:**
This component describes the physical shape and properties of an entity.

```xml
  <Component component_name="PhysicsShapeComponent" >
    <Var name="is_circle" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_box" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="friction" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="restitution" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="density" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows how an entity's physical form (circle, box, etc.) and its physical interactions like friction, restitution (bounciness), and density are defined.
