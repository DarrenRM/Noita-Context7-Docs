# a9bc24920c2e3e6bd4033fd7b6286e25

This XML file defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint, specifying the structure and data types for different aspects of game entities, such as AI behavior, health, and material properties. This schema is crucial for the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize the data associated with these components, enabling the creation of diverse enemies, items, and environmental interactions.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `GodInfoComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component. It includes the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `mana_current`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `enum GAME_EFFECT::Enum`, `unsigned int`, `double`, `class std::vector<double,class std::allocator<double> >`).

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Var>` elements nested within their respective `<Component>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components. This allows for modularity and reusability of game logic.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each `<Var>` element provides detailed information about a specific data point, including its name, size, and type. This is essential for data serialization and deserialization.
*   **String Representation:** String types are represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, indicating a standard C++ string implementation.
*   **Enums and Vectors:** The presence of types like `enum GAME_EFFECT::Enum` and `class std::vector<double,class std::allocator<double> >` suggests that components can utilize enumerated values for specific states or collections of data.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of fundamental data types are used, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`, `double`), booleans (`bool`), and strings.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
  <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This snippet defines variables related to an AI's attack capabilities. It includes parameters like `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `max_distance`, `angular_range_deg` for targeting, and `animation_name` and `attack_ranged_entity_file` for specifying attack visuals and projectiles.

**2. `AIComponent` Variables (partial):**

```xml
<Component component_name="AIComponent" >
  <Var name="hide_from_prey" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="food_material" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="eating_area_radius_x" size="4" type="int" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="defecates_and_pees" size="1" type="bool" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This section of the `AIComponent` schema shows variables related to an AI's basic behaviors, such as whether it hides from prey, what materials it considers food, its eating area dimensions, and whether it has bodily functions like defecating and peeing.

**3. `GodInfoComponent` Variables:**

```xml
<Component component_name="GodInfoComponent" >
  <Var name="mana_current" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="mana_max" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
  <Var name="gold" size="4" type="float" >
  </Var>
</Component>
```

This component defines attributes related to a "god" or player character's resources, specifically their current and maximum mana, and their gold reserves.
