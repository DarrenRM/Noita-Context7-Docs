# 7a8a40c5fa7f5547f387e55f6727a150

This file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. These components are the building blocks for entities within the game, dictating their behavior, appearance, and interactions. This schema file acts as a blueprint, specifying the types and names of variables that each component can possess, along with their data types and sizes. By defining these components, the game can systematically create and manage all the diverse elements players encounter, from enemies and items to environmental features.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute to identify it.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `radius`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their definition is contained within their attributes.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="7a8a40c5fa7f5547f387e55f6727a150" >
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <!-- ... other variables ... -->
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    <!-- ... variables for AIComponent ... -->
  </Component>
  <!-- ... other components ... -->
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game uses a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file enumerates and defines these components.
*   **Variable Types:** Common data types include `int` (integers), `float` (floating-point numbers), and `bool` (booleans). String-like data is represented by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive and often use camelCase or snake_case. Component names are also descriptive, indicating their function (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `CameraBoundComponent`).
*   **Categorization of Components:** Components appear to be grouped by their functional area, such as AI-related components (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`), movement components (`CardinalMovementComponent`), and visual/effect components (`EnergyShieldComponent`, `ExplodeOnDamageComponent`).
*   **Parameterization:** Each component is highly parameterized, allowing for fine-grained control over its behavior. For example, `AIAttackComponent` has variables for range, timing, and projectile properties.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:** This component defines the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.
    *   `use_probability`: An integer likely determining how often this attack is used.
    *   `min_distance` and `max_distance`: Floats defining the effective range of the attack.
    *   `animation_name`: A string specifying the animation to play when attacking.
    *   `attack_ranged_entity_file`: A string indicating the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks.

2.  **`CameraBoundComponent`:** This component seems to control how entities interact with the camera's boundaries.
    *   `enabled`: A boolean to toggle the component's functionality.
    *   `distance`: A float likely related to how far the entity can be from the camera.
    *   `max_count`: An integer, possibly limiting the number of entities with this component.

3.  **`EnergyShieldComponent`:** This component defines the properties of an energy shield.
    *   `radius`: A float for the shield's size.
    *   `damage_multiplier`: A float that might modify incoming damage.
    *   `max_energy`: A float representing the shield's maximum energy capacity.
    *   `recharge_speed`: A float indicating how quickly the shield regenerates energy.
