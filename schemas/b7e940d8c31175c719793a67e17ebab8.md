# b7e940d8c31175c719793a67e17ebab8

This XML file defines a schema for game entities and their properties within Noita. It acts as a blueprint or template, specifying the types of components that can be attached to game objects and the variables (attributes) each component can possess. This schema is fundamental to how the game constructs and manages its diverse entities, from enemies and items to environmental elements. By defining these components and their parameters, the game engine can instantiate and configure objects with specific behaviors, appearances, and interactions.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of functionality or data that can be applied to a game entity. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies it. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define the individual properties or variables that the component manages.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>` for transformations).

The structure is hierarchical: the root `<Schema>` element contains multiple `<Component>` elements, and each `<Component>` contains multiple `<Var>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The schema clearly follows a component-based design, where entities are composed of various functional components. This allows for modularity and reusability of game logic.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types like integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), and booleans (`bool`), as well as more complex types like strings and custom math structures.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are generally descriptive, indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`, `radius`, `throw_force_coeff`).
*   **AI and Physics Focus:** Several components appear to relate to Artificial Intelligence (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and physics (`PhysicsThrowableComponent`).
*   **Transformations:** Components like `InheritTransformComponent` suggest how entities' positions, rotations, and scales are managed and inherited.
*   **String Representation:** The `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` type is consistently used for string-based properties, such as names or file paths.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      </Component>
    ```
    This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities, including probabilities, distances, angles, animation names, and details about ranged attacks like the entity file to spawn.

2.  **`InheritTransformComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="InheritTransformComponent" >
      <Var name="use_root_parent" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="parent_hotspot_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="Transform" size="32" type="struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component seems to handle how an entity's transform (position, rotation, scale) is inherited from a parent, with options to use the root parent, specify a parent hotspot, and define the transform itself.

3.  **`PhysicsThrowableComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PhysicsThrowableComponent" >
      <Var name="throw_force_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_throw_speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_torque" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_torque" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines properties related to an object that can be thrown, including force coefficients, maximum speeds, and torque limits.
