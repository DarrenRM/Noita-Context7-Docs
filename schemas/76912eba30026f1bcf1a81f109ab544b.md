# 76912eba30026f1bcf1a81f109ab544b

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with different game entities and behaviors. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and utilize the data for entities like enemies, spells, and environmental interactions. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is organized and what parameters can be adjusted for each component.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct functional unit within the game. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`, `struct types::iaabb`, `enum MOVETOSURFACE_TYPE::Enum`).

The structure follows a consistent pattern:
```xml
<Schema hash="...">
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="...">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's data is organized around reusable components, each responsible for a specific aspect of an entity's behavior or properties.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of variables, detailing its configurable parameters.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`), string types (`class std::basic_string...`), vector types (`class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`), complex structures (`struct types::iaabb`), and enumerations (`enum ...::Enum`).
*   **AI Components:** Several components are related to Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, and `ControllerGoombaAIComponent`, suggesting a sophisticated AI system for enemies and other entities.
*   **Physics and Movement:** Components like `IKLimbComponent` and `IKLimbWalkerComponent` indicate systems for character animation and locomotion, likely involving inverse kinematics.
*   **Interaction and Effects:** Components like `ConsumableTeleportComponent` and those related to projectile properties (`set_projectile_to_liquid`, `suck_gold`, `suck_health`) point to mechanics for player interaction, environmental effects, and spellcasting.

## Sample Entries

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows how an AI can be configured with probabilities, ranges, and specific projectile entities for its attacks.

2.  **`ConsumableTeleportComponent`**: This component seems to define the behavior of consumable items that facilitate teleportation.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ConsumableTeleportComponent" >
      <Var name="create_other_end" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="is_at_home" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="target_location" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<float>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mNextUsableFrame" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This indicates properties like whether to create a destination point, its current state, and its target coordinates.

3.  **`IKLimbWalkerComponent`**: This component likely governs the walking behavior of entities using inverse kinematics for their limbs.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="IKLimbWalkerComponent" >
      <Var name="ground_attachment_min_spread" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="ground_attachment_max_tries" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="ground_attachment_max_angle" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="leg_velocity_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines parameters related to how limbs attach to the ground, including spread, attempts, angles, and velocity influences.
