# 367f4079dc079cfe25dd32b7ac75a522

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with different game entities and systems. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and utilize the data for elements like AI behaviors, character properties, particle effects, and more. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game data is organized and what parameters can be adjusted for different game objects.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains these components.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the type of component it defines (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `CharacterCollisionComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `radius`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `struct LensValue<float>` for specific float structures, `class std::vector<int,class std::allocator<int> >` for integer vectors, `enum PARTICLE_EMITTER_CUSTOM_STYLE::Enum` for enums).

Some `<Var>` elements may contain nested elements, though in the provided samples, they are typically empty, indicating that the variable's value is defined elsewhere or is a primitive type.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="367f4079dc079cfe25dd32b7ac75a522" >
  <Component component_name="ComponentName" >
    <Var name="variable_name_1" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_2" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    </Component>
  </Component>
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Organization:** The data is clearly organized by game component, allowing for modular definition of game object properties.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined as individual `<Var>` elements with explicit names, sizes, and types.
*   **Data Type Variety:** The schema supports a range of data types, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`), string representations, vector types, custom struct types (`LensValue`), and enumerations.
*   **AI and Character Focus:** A significant portion of the sampled components relate to AI behavior (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and character properties (`CharacterCollisionComponent`, `CharacterDataComponent`).
*   **Particle Systems:** Components like those related to particle emission (`PARTICLE_EMITTER_CUSTOM_STYLE`) are also defined, indicating the schema's scope.
*   **Specific Component Functionality:** Components like `EnergyShieldComponent` and `ExplodeOnDamageComponent` reveal specific game mechanics being defined.

## Sample Entries

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:** This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.
    *   `use_probability`: An integer likely controlling how often this attack is used.
    *   `min_distance` and `max_distance`: Floats defining the effective range of the attack.
    *   `animation_name`: A string specifying the animation to play during the attack.
    *   `attack_ranged_entity_file`: A string indicating the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks.

    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      </Component>
    ```

2.  **`CharacterDataComponent`:** This component holds fundamental data about a character's physical properties and collision.
    *   `platforming_type`: An integer likely categorizing the character's movement or interaction with platforms.
    *   `collision_aabb_min_x`, `collision_aabb_max_x`, `collision_aabb_min_y`, `collision_aabb_max_y`: These variables, using `struct LensValue<float>`, define the bounding box for collision detection.
    *   `mass`: A float representing the character's mass.

    ```xml
    <Component component_name="CharacterDataComponent" >
      <Var name="platforming_type" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="collision_aabb_min_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mass" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```

3.  **`EnergyShieldComponent`:** This component defines the properties of an energy shield.
    *   `radius`: A float for the shield's radius.
    *   `max_energy`: A float for the maximum energy capacity of the shield.
    *   `recharge_speed`: A float indicating how quickly the shield recharges.
    *   `energy`: A float representing the current energy level.

    ```xml
    <Component component_name="EnergyShieldComponent" >
      <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_energy" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="recharge_speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="energy" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
