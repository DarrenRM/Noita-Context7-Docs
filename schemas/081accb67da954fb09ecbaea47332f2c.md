# 081accb67da954fb09ecbaea47332f2c

This XML file, identified by the hash `081accb67da954fb09ecbaea47332f2c`, defines a schema for game data within Noita. It appears to be a blueprint or template for how certain game entities or components are structured and what data they contain. These schemas are fundamental to the game's engine, dictating the properties and behaviors of everything from enemies and spells to environmental elements and UI components. By defining these structures, the game can consistently load, interpret, and utilize game data.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains a `hash` attribute. Inside the `<Schema>` element, the primary organizational unit is the `<Component>` tag. Each `<Component>` tag has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the specific type of component or entity it describes.

Within each `<Component>`, data is defined using `<Var>` tags. Each `<Var>` tag represents a variable or property associated with that component and has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `cooldown_frames`, `sprite_file`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This indicates the memory allocation for the data.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. This can range from primitive types like `int`, `float`, and `bool` to more complex C++ types such as `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>` (a 2D vector of integers).

The `<Var>` tags themselves are typically empty, as their purpose is to define the structure and metadata of the variable, not to hold its actual value.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The game data is organized around distinct `Component` types, suggesting a component-based entity system. Each component encapsulates a specific set of functionalities or properties.
*   **Variable Definitions**: The `<Var>` tag is consistently used to define individual data fields within a component. The `name`, `size`, and `type` attributes provide crucial information about each variable.
*   **Data Type Variety**: A mix of fundamental data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ types (strings, vectors, custom math structures like `CVector2` and `CXForm`) are used, reflecting the game's sophisticated data handling.
*   **Naming Conventions**: Variable names are generally descriptive, indicating their purpose (e.g., `min_distance`, `max_distance`, `cooldown_frames`, `sprite_file`).
*   **String Representation**: Strings are consistently represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, indicating their underlying C++ implementation.
*   **Math Structures**: Custom math structures like `ceng::math::CVector2` and `ceng::math::CXForm` are used for representing positions, dimensions, and transformations.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component appears to define parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability, range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), animation names, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

2.  **`AbilityComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AbilityComponent" >
      <Var name="cooldown_frames" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="sprite_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mana" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="mana_max" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component likely defines properties for player or entity abilities. It includes variables for cooldown duration, associated entity and sprite files, and mana costs/limits.

3.  **`InventoryComponent`**:
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="InventoryComponent" >
      <Var name="ui_container_type" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="ui_container_size" size="8" type="class ceng::math::CVector2<int>" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="ui_element_sprite" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component seems to govern the game's inventory system, specifically its user interface aspects. It defines parameters for the inventory container's type and size, as well as the sprite used for inventory elements.
