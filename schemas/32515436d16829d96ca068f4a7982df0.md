# 32515436d16829d96ca068f4a7982df0

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with different game entities and mechanics. These components are fundamental building blocks that dictate how objects behave, interact, and are rendered in the game world. By defining these components, the game can systematically load and manage the attributes of everything from enemies and projectiles to environmental interactions and player abilities.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual variables.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema file.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ItemStashComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a single variable within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `struct LensValue<float>` for structured float values).

The structure is hierarchical, with components containing variables. The variables themselves can be simple primitive types or more complex structures.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly demonstrates a component-based architecture, where game logic and data are organized into reusable components.
*   **Variable Naming Conventions:** Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `attack_ranged_predict`, `kick_radius`, `speed_threshold`).
*   **Data Type Variety:** A range of data types are used, including integers (`int`, `unsigned int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings. More complex types like `struct LensValue<float>` suggest structured data for values that might have additional properties or modifiers.
*   **AI and Behavior Definitions:** A significant portion of the components appear to relate to Artificial Intelligence (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`), defining parameters for enemy behavior, attacks, and movement.
*   **Physics and Collision:** Components like `PhysicsBodyCollisionDamageComponent` and `PhysicsBodyComponent` define physical properties and how entities interact with the game's physics engine.
*   **Item and Inventory:** Components like `ItemStashComponent` suggest definitions for items and how they are stored or interacted with.

## Sample Entries

**1. `AIAttackComponent` (from first 100 lines):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_shooting_ok_angle_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This entry defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability, range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), aiming (`angular_range_deg`, `attack_ranged_aim_rotation_speed`), attack duration, associated animations, and details about ranged attacks such as the entity file to spawn, count, and whether a laser sight is used.

**2. `KickComponent` (from lines 3048-3098):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="KickComponent" >
    <Var name="can_kick" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_force" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="player_kickforce" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="kick_radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="kick_damage" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="kick_knockback" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="telekinesis_throw_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component defines the mechanics of a "kick" action. It specifies if kicking is allowed (`can_kick`), the maximum force applied (`max_force`), player-specific kick force (`player_kickforce`), the radius of the kick effect (`kick_radius`), and the damage and knockback associated with it. It also includes a variable related to telekinesis throw speed, suggesting a potential overlap or related functionality.

**3. `PhysicsBodyComponent` (from lines 4299-4349):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="PhysicsBodyComponent" >
    <Var name="is_external" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="hax_fix_going_through_ground" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="hax_fix_going_through_sand" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="hax_wait_till_pixel_scenes_loaded" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="uid" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="linear_damping" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component defines the physical properties of an entity. It includes flags for external physics, specific "hacks" or fixes for collision issues with ground and sand, a flag to wait for scene loading, a unique identifier (`uid`), an enabled state, and a `linear_damping` value which affects how quickly an object loses velocity.
