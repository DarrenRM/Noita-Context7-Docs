# 8504347dcb96fd196cec111e37d2d33f

This XML file, identified by its hash `8504347dcb96fd196cec111e37d2d33f`, defines a collection of game components and their associated variables. These components likely represent different functionalities or behaviors that can be attached to entities within the game Noita. The file acts as a schema, outlining the structure and types of data used to configure these components. This is crucial for game development, allowing for modular design and easy modification of entity properties and behaviors. For modders and developers, understanding this schema is key to customizing or creating new game elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document with a root `<Schema>` element. Inside the `<Schema>` element, there are multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct game component and has a `component_name` attribute that identifies it.

Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties that belong to that component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the data type.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, as their definition is contained within their attributes.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="8504347dcb96fd196cec111e37d2d33f" >

  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    </Component>

  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    </Component>

</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several patterns emerge from the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design**: The game's logic is heavily component-based, with distinct functionalities grouped into named components.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component is defined by a set of variables, each with a specific name, size, and type.
*   **Data Types**: Common data types include integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings (represented by `class std::basic_string...`).
*   **AI and Behavior Components**: A significant portion of the sampled components relate to Artificial Intelligence (`AIComponent`, `AIAttackComponent`), suggesting complex enemy and NPC behaviors are defined here.
*   **Physical and Environmental Properties**: Components like `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent` and variables related to fire (`is_on_fire`, `fire_probability_of_ignition`) indicate definitions for physical interactions and environmental effects.
*   **Procedural Generation Elements**: Variables like `add_perlin_scale_x`, `add_perlin_scale_y`, `rare_use_perlin`, and `rare_scale_x` suggest that this file might also be involved in defining parameters for procedural generation of terrain or other game elements.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

This component appears to define the parameters for an AI entity's attack capabilities.

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

*   `use_probability`: Likely controls how often this attack is used.
*   `min_distance`, `max_distance`: Define the effective range of the attack.
*   `angular_range_deg`: Specifies the cone of fire or targeting angle.
*   `animation_name`: The name of the animation to play when attacking.
*   `attack_ranged_entity_file`: The file path to the entity (e.g., projectile) spawned for ranged attacks.

**2. `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent` Variables:**

This component seems to define how an entity damages other entities within a certain radius.

```xml
  <Component component_name="DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="knockback_multiplier" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
```

*   `radius`: The area of effect for the damage.
*   `damage_min`, `damage_max`: The range of damage dealt.
*   `knockback_multiplier`: How much force is applied to push affected entities.

**3. Procedural Generation Related Variables (within an unnamed component in the sample):**

These variables suggest parameters for generating noise patterns, likely for terrain or visual effects.

```xml
    <Var name="add_perlin_scale_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_rare" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="limit_y" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="rare_scale_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="rare_scale_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
```

*   `add_perlin_scale_y`: Controls the scaling of Perlin noise in the Y dimension.
*   `is_rare`: A flag indicating if this generation pattern is rare.
*   `limit_y`: Whether to limit the generation within a Y-axis range.
*   `rare_scale_x`, `rare_scale_y`: Scaling factors for rare generation patterns.
