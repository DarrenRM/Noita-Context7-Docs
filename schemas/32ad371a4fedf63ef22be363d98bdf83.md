# 32ad371a4fedf63ef22be363d98bdf83

This XML file defines the structure and data types for various game components in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining how different game entities and their behaviors are represented in the game's data files. By defining these components and their associated variables, this file enables the game engine to load, interpret, and utilize the vast array of elements that make up the Noita world, from enemy AI and item properties to environmental interactions and magical effects.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document with a root `<Schema>` tag. Inside this, various `<Component>` tags define distinct game components. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Within each component, `<Var>` tags define individual data variables.

Each `<Var>` tag has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `class std::vector<int,class std::allocator<int> >` for integer vectors).

The structure is hierarchical:
```xml
<Schema>
  <Component component_name="[Component Name]">
    <Var name="[Variable Name]" size="[Size]" type="[Data Type]"></Var>
    <!-- ... more variables ... -->
  </Component>
  <!-- ... more components ... -->
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file heavily relies on a component-based architecture, where distinct functionalities are encapsulated within named components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `CellEaterComponent`, `ItemActionComponent`).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is composed of numerous `<Var>` tags, detailing the specific data points required for that component's operation.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** The `type` attribute provides precise information about the kind of data each variable holds, ranging from simple integers and booleans to complex string and vector types.
*   **AI and Behavior Components:** A significant portion of the components appear to relate to Artificial Intelligence (`AIComponent`, `AIAttackComponent`) and character/entity behaviors.
*   **Item and Material Properties:** Components like `ItemActionComponent` and those related to material conversion suggest definitions for items, their actions, and how they interact with the game's material system.
*   **Physical and Collision Properties:** Components such as `CharacterCollisionComponent` indicate definitions for how entities interact physically with the environment and each other.

## Sample Entries

**1. AIAttackComponent:**
This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.
```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" ></Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" ></Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" ></Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" ></Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" ></Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" ></Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" ></Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" ></Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables controlling attack frequency (`use_probability`), range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), targeting (`angular_range_deg`), animation (`animation_name`), and the specifics of ranged attacks, including the entity to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_file`) and its quantity (`attack_ranged_entity_count_min`, `attack_ranged_entity_count_max`).

**2. CellEaterComponent:**
This component defines how certain entities consume or interact with materials in the environment.
```xml
  <Component component_name="CellEaterComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" ></Var>
    <Var name="eat_probability" size="4" type="int" ></Var>
    <Var name="ignored_material" size="4" type="int" ></Var>
    <Var name="limited_materials" size="1" type="bool" ></Var>
    <Var name="materials" size="12" type="class std::vector<int,class std::allocator<int> >" ></Var>
  </Component>
```
Here, `radius` defines the area of effect, `eat_probability` controls the chance of consumption, `ignored_material` specifies materials that won't be eaten, and `limited_materials` along with the `materials` vector allow for a specific list of materials to be targeted.

**3. ItemActionComponent:**
This component likely defines the actions associated with an item.
```xml
  <Component component_name="ItemActionComponent" >
    <Var name="action_id" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" ></Var>
  </Component>
```
The `action_id` variable suggests a string identifier that links the item to a specific game action or behavior.
