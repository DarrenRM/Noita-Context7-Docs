# 2daf1a5cbc8af57a97af066c200353f7

This XML file, identified by the hash `2daf1a5cbc8af57a97af066c200353f7`, defines the structure and properties of various game components and entities within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and attributes that make up different game elements, such as AI behaviors, character statistics, and particle effects. This file is crucial for the game's engine to understand and instantiate these components, dictating how entities will behave, interact, and appear in the game world.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. The root element `<Schema>` encloses all these components and includes a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema definition.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute, which clearly labels the type of component it defines. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `animation_name`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes. This often correlates with the data type.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. Common types observed include:
    *   `int`: Integer numbers.
    *   `float`: Floating-point numbers.
    *   `bool`: Boolean values (true/false).
    *   `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`: String types.
    *   `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`: A 2D vector of floats.
    *   `enum PARTICLE_EMITTER_CUSTOM_STYLE::Enum`: An enumeration type for particle emitter styles.

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, indicating that their definition and data are managed externally, likely through a separate data file that references this schema.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly follows a component-based design, where game entities are composed of various functional components. This is evident from the repeated `<Component>` tags.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's behavior and properties are defined by a list of `<Var>` elements, specifying the name, size, and type of each configurable parameter.
*   **AI and Character Focus:** A significant portion of the schema appears dedicated to defining AI behaviors (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and character-specific attributes (`CharacterStatsComponent`).
*   **Physics and Animation:** Components related to movement, animation, and physics are present, such as `IKLimbComponent`, `IKLimbWalkerComponent`, and variables related to animation names and movement parameters.
*   **Particle Systems:** The schema includes definitions for particle emitters (`ParticleEmitterComponent`), suggesting control over visual effects like trails, emission rates, and rendering properties.
*   **Data Type Specificity:** The `type` attribute provides precise information about the kind of data expected for each variable, aiding in data interpretation and modification.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for the probability of using an attack, the minimum and maximum distances for attacks, the name of the animation associated with the attack, and the entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks.

**2. `AIComponent` Movement Variables:**
```xml
    <Var name="swim_extra_horizontal_drag" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="mouse_look" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_to_play" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
This snippet from the `AIComponent` shows variables related to movement and animation. `swim_extra_horizontal_drag` likely controls how much an AI is affected by drag when swimming. `mouse_look` suggests whether the AI's view is controlled by the mouse, and `animation_to_play` specifies which animation the AI should currently be performing.

**3. `ParticleEmitterComponent` Emission Variables:**
```xml
    <Var name="count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="emission_interval_min_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="emission_interval_max_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="emission_chance" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="is_emitting" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```
This section from the `ParticleEmitterComponent` defines how particles are emitted. It includes variables for the maximum number of particles, the minimum and maximum intervals (in frames) between emissions, the chance of emission, and a boolean flag to control whether the emitter is currently active.
