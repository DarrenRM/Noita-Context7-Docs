# bbadd9255bcd678544733b9074706849

This XML file, identified by the hash `bbadd9255bcd678544733b9074706849`, defines a schema for game data within Noita. It appears to be a blueprint or template for how various game entities and their properties are structured and represented. These schemas are fundamental to the game's engine, dictating the types of components that can be attached to game objects and the variables within those components. This allows for a consistent and organized way to manage the vast amount of data that makes up the game world, from enemy behaviors to player statistics and UI elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct functional part of a game entity. These components are grouped under a root `<Schema>` tag.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that clearly identifies its purpose (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ControlsComponent`, `InventoryComponent`, `PlayerStatsComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define the individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The specific name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `enabled`, `lives`).
*   **`size`**: The memory size allocated for this variable, often indicated in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<int>` (likely a 2D vector of integers).

The structure is hierarchical: the schema contains components, and components contain variables.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The file strongly suggests a component-based entity system, where game objects are composed of various functional components.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each variable within a component is explicitly defined with its name, size, and type, providing a clear contract for how data should be stored and interpreted.
*   **Data Types**: A mix of fundamental data types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ types is used, indicating a sophisticated underlying game engine. String types are represented by `std::basic_string`, and 2D vectors by `ceng::math::CVector2`.
*   **AI and Player Focus**: Several components observed in the samples relate to Artificial Intelligence (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and player-specific functionalities (`ControlsComponent`, `PlayerCollisionComponent`, `PlayerStatsComponent`), highlighting the schema's role in defining character behaviors and attributes.
*   **UI and Inventory**: Components like `InventoryComponent` and `InventoryGuiComponent` suggest definitions for how inventory systems and their user interfaces are structured.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for the probability of using an attack, the range (minimum and maximum distance), the name of the attack animation, and the entity file to be used for ranged attacks. This component likely governs how enemies or NPCs perform offensive actions.

**2. `ControlsComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="polymorph_hax" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="gamepad_indirect_aiming_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```

This component seems to manage player input and control schemes. Variables like `polymorph_hax` (potentially related to special abilities or transformations), `enabled` (to toggle controls), and `gamepad_indirect_aiming_enabled` indicate settings for how the player interacts with the game, including gamepad specific features.

**3. `PlayerStatsComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="lives" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_hp" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
```

This component clearly defines core player statistics. `lives` tracks the number of remaining lives, and `max_hp` sets the maximum health points the player can have. This is a fundamental component for any playable character.
