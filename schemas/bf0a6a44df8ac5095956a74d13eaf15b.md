# bf0a6a44df8ac5095956a74d13eaf15b

This XML file, identified by the hash `bf0a6a44df8ac5095956a74d13eaf15b`, defines the internal structure and properties of various game components and entities within Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint, dictating how different game elements are configured and how they behave. This is crucial for the game's engine to load, interpret, and instantiate these elements correctly, from enemy AI behaviors to particle effects and damage mechanics. Understanding this file is essential for anyone looking to deeply analyze or modify the game's mechanics.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game logic or data. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains these components.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that clearly identifies the type of component it defines (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `radius`, `damage_min`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the data type.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable. Common types include `int`, `float`, `bool`, and string types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`. Some types are more specific, like `enum DAMAGE_TYPES::Enum` or `struct LensValue<int>`, indicating enumerated values or custom data structures.

The structure is hierarchical, with the `<Schema>` containing `<Component>`s, and `<Component>`s containing `<Var>`s.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly demonstrates a component-based design. Each `<Component>` encapsulates a specific set of functionalities or data, allowing for modularity and reusability.
*   **Variable Definitions:** The `<Var>` tags are used consistently to define the parameters for each component. The `type` attribute is particularly informative for understanding the expected data.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Variable names are generally descriptive, giving a good indication of their purpose (e.g., `min_distance`, `damage_max`, `emission_interval_min_frames`).
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, from fundamental types like integers and floats to more complex enumerated types and custom structs, reflecting the diverse needs of game mechanics.
*   **AI and Behavior:** Several components, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`, suggest a focus on defining enemy AI behaviors, including attack patterns, movement, and sensory capabilities.
*   **Damage and Effects:** Components like `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent` highlight how damage and its associated effects (like knockback) are defined.
*   **Particle Systems:** The presence of variables like `airflow_force`, `emission_interval_min_frames`, and `custom_style` within a component (likely related to particle emitters) indicates how visual effects are configured.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This snippet shows variables defining an AI's attack capabilities. `use_probability` likely controls how often an attack is used, `min_distance` and `max_distance` define its effective range, `animation_name` specifies the animation to play during the attack, and `attack_ranged_entity_file` points to the projectile or entity spawned for ranged attacks.

**2. `AIComponent` Variables (related to creature behavior):**

```xml
    <Var name="eating_area_radius_x" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="eating_area_radius_y" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="defecates_and_pees" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="needs_food" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="sense_creatures" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="can_fly" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```

This section from the `AIComponent` details aspects of a creature's basic behavior. It includes parameters for its "eating area," whether it can defecate/pee, if it requires food, if it can sense other creatures, and if it has the ability to fly.

**3. `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent" >

    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="damage_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="damage_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="time_between_damaging" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="damage_type" size="4" type="enum DAMAGE_TYPES::Enum" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="target_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This component defines how an entity can damage other entities within a certain radius. `radius` sets the area of effect, `damage_min` and `damage_max` define the damage range, `time_between_damaging` controls the frequency, `damage_type` specifies the type of damage (e.g., fire, ice), and `target_tag` likely filters which entities can be affected.
