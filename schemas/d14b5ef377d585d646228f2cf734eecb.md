# d14b5ef377d585d646228f2cf734eecb

This XML file, `d14b5ef377d585d646228f2cf734eecb.xml`, defines the structure and properties of various game components and entities within Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint, dictating how different game elements are configured and how they behave. This file is crucial for the game's internal logic, defining attributes for AI, physics, rendering, and more. Understanding this schema is essential for anyone looking to delve into the game's data, particularly for modding purposes, as it outlines the available parameters for customizing game entities.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. These components are identified by their `component_name` attribute. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables or properties associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following key attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `enum EXPLOSION_TRIGGER_TYPE::Enum`, `class ConfigExplosion`, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`).

The structure follows a hierarchical pattern:
```xml
<Schema ...>
  <Component component_name="...">
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
      <!-- Optional: nested structures or further definitions -->
    </Var>
    <Var name="..." size="..." type="...">
    </Var>
    ...
  </Component>
  <Component component_name="...">
    ...
  </Component>
  ...
</Schema>
```
The `size` attribute often indicates the memory footprint of the variable, while the `type` attribute specifies its data representation. Complex types, like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, represent strings, and `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` likely represents 2D vectors.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's entities are built by combining various components, each responsible for a specific aspect of behavior or functionality (e.g., AI, physics, rendering).
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables (`<Var>`) that hold its configuration parameters.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`) and more complex C++ class types, indicating the underlying programming language and data structures used.
*   **AI Components:** Components like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` define parameters for enemy behavior, attack patterns, targeting, and movement.
*   **Physics and Collision:** Components such as `CrawlerAnimalComponent` and implied physics properties within other components suggest detailed control over entity movement and interaction with the environment.
*   **Visual and Particle Effects:** Components like `ExplosionComponent` and the presence of variables related to color and offsets in particle-related components point to the definition of visual effects.
*   **Control Schemes:** `ControlsComponent` defines parameters related to player input and control schemes, including gamepad specific settings.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), accuracy (`angular_range_deg`), timing (`state_duration_frames`, `frames_between`), animation used during attacks (`animation_name`), and details about ranged attacks, including the entity file to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_file`) and the number of entities to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_count_min`, `attack_ranged_entity_count_max`).

2.  **`ExplosionComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ExplosionComponent" >
      <Var name="trigger" size="4" type="enum EXPLOSION_TRIGGER_TYPE::Enum" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="config_explosion" size="356" type="class ConfigExplosion" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="timeout_frames" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="kill_entity" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This component governs how explosions function. It specifies the trigger condition for the explosion (`trigger`), a reference to a detailed explosion configuration (`config_explosion`), a delay before the explosion occurs (`timeout_frames`), and whether the explosion should kill the entity that spawned it (`kill_entity`).

3.  **`ControlsComponent`:**
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ControlsComponent" >
      <Var name="polymorph_hax" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="gamepad_indirect_aiming_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="gamepad_fire_on_thumbstick_extend" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      ...
    </Component>
    ```
    This component defines player control settings. It includes boolean flags for various control features, such as a "polymorph hack" (`polymorph_hax`), general enablement (`enabled`), and specific gamepad aiming and firing behaviors (`gamepad_indirect_aiming_enabled`, `gamepad_fire_on_thumbstick_extend`).
