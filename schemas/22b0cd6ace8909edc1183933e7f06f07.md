# 22b0cd6ace8909edc1183933e7f06f07

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the types of data and their attributes that can be associated with different game entities and systems. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to understand and instantiate objects, behaviors, and effects. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how game elements are configured.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable.
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. This can include primitive types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `struct ValueRange`.

Some `<Var>` elements may contain nested structures or other `<Var>` elements, indicating more complex data types.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture**: The file clearly follows a component-based design, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AltarComponent`, `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent`).
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying their name, size, and type.
*   **Data Types**: A variety of data types are used, ranging from basic numerical and boolean types to complex string representations and custom structs like `ValueRange` and `ceng::math::CVector2<float>`.
*   **AI Components**: A significant portion of the defined components appear to be related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) for various entities, such as `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `AdvancedFishAIComponent`, and `AnimalAIComponent`. These components define parameters for movement, attack patterns, states, and more.
*   **Physical and Effect Components**: Components related to physical properties and effects are also present, such as `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent`, and variables related to fire and wetness status effects.
*   **Configuration Parameters**: The variables within components often represent configurable parameters that dictate the behavior and characteristics of game entities. For example, `min_distance`, `max_distance`, `state_duration_frames` in `AIAttackComponent` control attack behavior.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows how an AI's attack range, probability, animation, and projectile properties are defined.

**2. `AltarComponent`:**
This component likely defines the behavior and properties of altars in the game.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AltarComponent" >
    <Var name="recognized_entity_tags" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="good_fx_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="neutral_fx_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="evil_fx_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="uses_remaining" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This indicates that altars can recognize specific entity tags and have associated visual effects (FX materials) for different states (good, neutral, evil), along with a count of remaining uses.

**3. `DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent`:**
This component defines how an entity can damage other entities in its vicinity.

```xml
  <Component component_name="DamageNearbyEntitiesComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="damage_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="target_vec_max_len" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows parameters for the area of effect (`radius`), the minimum and maximum damage dealt, and a parameter related to targeting.

**4. Particle/Effect Generation Parameters:**
This sample shows variables related to the generation and behavior of particles or effects.

```xml
    <Var name="x_pos_offset_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="y_pos_offset_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="area_circle_radius" size="8" type="struct ValueRange" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="x_vel_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="y_vel_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="lifetime_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="lifetime_max" size="4" type="float" >
```
These variables define spatial offsets, velocity ranges, and lifetime durations for generated effects, suggesting parameters for particle systems or projectile behavior.
