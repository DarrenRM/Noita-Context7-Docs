# 48e2e231d903d6826cd5ced5c76a1461

This XML file defines the structure and data types for various components used within the game Noita. These components represent different functionalities and properties that can be attached to game entities, such as enemies, spells, or environmental objects. This schema file acts as a blueprint, dictating how data for these components is organized and what types of values they can hold. Understanding this file is crucial for comprehending how game mechanics are implemented and for modding the game, as it outlines the available parameters for customization.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and has a `component_name` attribute to identify it.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties within that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable.
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the data type.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. This can range from primitive types like `int`, `float`, and `bool` to more complex C++ types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or custom game classes like `struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>`.

The structure is hierarchical: `<Schema>` contains `<Component>`s, and `<Component>`s contain `<Var>`s.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various functional components.
*   **Data Type Specification**: Each variable has a clearly defined `type` and `size`, which is essential for the game engine to correctly interpret and serialize/deserialize data.
*   **String Representation**: C++ standard library string types are explicitly defined, indicating how text-based data like filenames or animation names are handled.
*   **Mathematical Structures**: The presence of types like `struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>` and `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` suggests that the game utilizes custom math libraries for transformations and vector operations.
*   **Boolean Flags**: Many variables are of type `bool` (size 1), used for enabling or disabling specific behaviors or features within a component.
*   **Numerical Parameters**: `int` and `float` types are prevalent, used for numerical values such as probabilities, distances, durations, offsets, and speeds.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```

This section defines parameters for an AI component responsible for attacking. It includes variables for attack probability, range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), the name of the attack animation, and the entity file to be spawned for ranged attacks.

**2. `AudioComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AudioComponent" >

    <Var name="file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="event_root" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="set_latest_event_position" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="play_only_if_visible" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

  </Component>
```

This component handles audio playback. It defines variables for the audio file to be played, an event root for sound management, and boolean flags to control whether the sound's position is updated and if it only plays when visible.

**3. `LightningComponent` Variables:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="LightningComponent" >

    <Var name="config_explosion" size="368" type="class ConfigExplosion" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="sprite_lightning_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="is_projectile" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>

    <Var name="explosion_type" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>

  </Component>
```

This component defines properties related to lightning effects. It includes a reference to an explosion configuration, the sprite file for the lightning, a flag indicating if it's a projectile, and an integer for the explosion type.
