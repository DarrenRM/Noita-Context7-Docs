# 2a64738a8a7b0e4e3b9b489e256396ed

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. These components are fundamental building blocks for entities, behaviors, and game mechanics. The file acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for variables associated with each component, enabling the game engine to correctly interpret and utilize these definitions. Essentially, it's a blueprint for how different parts of the game world are configured.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct game component and has a `component_name` attribute to identify it.

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual variables or properties associated with that component. Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable.
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `struct types::aabb`).

The content within a `<Var>` tag is typically empty, as the definition is provided by its attributes.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="2a64738a8a7b0e4e3b9b489e256396ed" >
  <Component component_name="ComponentName" >
    <Var name="variable_name_1" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_2" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    </Component>
  </Component>
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where distinct functionalities are encapsulated into named components.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component is defined by a set of variables, each with a specific name, size, and data type.
*   **String Representation**: String types are consistently represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Numeric Types**: Common numeric types like `int` and `float` are used, with `size` indicating their memory footprint. `unsigned int` is also present.
*   **Boolean Types**: `bool` is used for true/false values.
*   **Complex Types**: Structures like `struct types::aabb` are used for more complex data representations.
*   **Organization**: Components appear to be grouped logically, though the exact order might not be strictly significant for the schema itself.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component seems to define parameters related to an AI's attack behavior.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows variables for attack range, angles, animation triggers, and the entity file used for ranged attacks.

2.  **`ItemChestComponent`**: This component likely defines the properties of chests or containers that hold items.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ItemChestComponent" >
      <Var name="item_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="item_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="level" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="enemy_drop" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="actions" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    Variables here include minimum and maximum item counts, the level of the chest, whether it's an enemy drop, and associated actions.

3.  **`MaterialAreaCheckerComponent`**: This component appears to be related to checking for specific materials within a defined area.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="MaterialAreaCheckerComponent" >
      <Var name="look_for_failure" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="area_aabb" size="16" type="struct types::aabb" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="material" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="material2" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="kill_after_message" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component includes a boolean for failure detection, an axis-aligned bounding box (`aabb`) for the area, and definitions for materials to check.
