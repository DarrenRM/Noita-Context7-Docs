# 861774c1729100e55728b9228c919e30

This XML file, identified by the hash `861774c1729100e55728b9228c919e30`, defines the structure and properties of various game components within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the types of data and their attributes that can be associated with different game entities or systems. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to understand how to instantiate, configure, and manage these components, influencing everything from enemy AI behavior to environmental effects.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute that uniquely identifies this schema definition.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that names the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `ArcComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `radius`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string, `enum ARC_TYPE::Enum`).

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Var>` elements nested within their respective `<Component>` elements.

## Key Patterns

Several patterns are evident in the sampled data:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game appears to utilize a component-based architecture, where functionality is broken down into modular components. Each component encapsulates specific behaviors or data.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, specifying their names, data types, and sizes. This allows for granular control over the properties of each component.
*   **Data Types:** A variety of data types are used, including integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings (represented by `class std::basic_string...`). Enums are also used for specific enumerated values.
*   **AI Components:** A significant portion of the sampled data relates to AI components, such as `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`. These define parameters for enemy behavior, including attack ranges, movement, and sensory capabilities.
*   **Environmental/Visual Components:** Components like `ArcComponent`, `FlyingComponent`, and `FogOfWarRadiusComponent` suggest definitions for visual effects, environmental interactions, and game mechanics related to visibility.
*   **Material Properties:** Components like the one sampled from lines 3320-3370 seem to define properties related to materials, including their indices, minimum/maximum values, and how perlin noise might affect them.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for the probability of using an attack, the effective range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), the angular spread of the attack (`angular_range_deg`), the duration of the attack state, the name of the associated animation, and details about ranged attacks such as the entity file to spawn, and the minimum/maximum count of entities to spawn.

**2. `AIComponent` (partial sample):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    <Var name="pee_velocity_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="pee_velocity_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="needs_food" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="sense_creatures" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="can_fly" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="can_walk" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="path_distance_to_target_node_to_turn_around" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="mAggression" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component likely governs general AI behavior. It includes variables related to movement (`pee_velocity_x`, `pee_velocity_y`), basic needs (`needs_food`), sensory perception (`sense_creatures`), locomotion abilities (`can_fly`, `can_walk`), pathfinding parameters, and aggression levels.

**3. `FlyingComponent`:**

```xml
  <Component component_name="FlyingComponent" >
    <Var name="type" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="perlin_freq" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="perlin_time_freq" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="perlin_wind_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="perlin_wind_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component seems to control entities that can fly. It includes parameters for Perlin noise, likely used to simulate wind or atmospheric effects that influence flight. Variables like `perlin_freq`, `perlin_time_freq`, `perlin_wind_x`, and `perlin_wind_y` suggest procedural generation of movement patterns or environmental forces.
