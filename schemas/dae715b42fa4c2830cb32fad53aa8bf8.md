# dae715b42fa4c2830cb32fad53aa8bf8

This XML file, identified by the hash `dae715b42fa4c2830cb32fad53aa8bf8`, defines the structure and properties of various game components and entities within Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the data types and names for different attributes that make up game objects, such as enemies, spells, and environmental elements. This file is crucial for the game's engine to understand and instantiate these entities with their specific behaviors and characteristics. By defining these components, the game can manage complex interactions, AI behaviors, physical properties, and visual effects.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. These components are identified by a `component_name` attribute. Within each `<Component>`, individual properties are defined using `<Var>` tags.

Each `<Var>` tag has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable or property.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`). The string type often represents a string or a file path.

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Component>` tags containing multiple `<Var>` tags.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game entities are composed of various functional components. Examples include `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `KickComponent`, and `LevitationComponent`.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined as individual variables (`<Var>`). The `type` attribute is particularly informative, indicating whether a value is a number (integer or float), a boolean flag, or a string (often used for entity names or animation sequences).
*   **AI and Behavior Definitions:** Several components, like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent`, define parameters related to enemy behavior, such as attack ranges, probabilities, animation names, and movement logic.
*   **Physical Properties:** Components like `KickComponent` and `LevitationComponent` define physical attributes such as force, radius, and damage, which influence how entities interact with the game world.
*   **String Types:** The `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` type consistently appears for variables that store names or file paths, such as `animation_name` and `attack_ranged_entity_file`.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component defines the parameters for an entity's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="frames_between" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_use_laser_sight" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_speed" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_shooting_ok_angle_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This section details how an AI entity might attack, including its range, timing, animations, and projectile properties.

**2. `KickComponent`:**
This component defines the mechanics of a "kick" action.

```xml
  <Component component_name="KickComponent" >
    <Var name="max_force" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="player_kickforce" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="kick_radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="kick_damage" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="kick_knockback" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component likely governs actions like a player's melee attack or an enemy's physical shove, specifying force, damage, and area of effect. The `struct LensValue<float>` type suggests a more complex value that might include scaling or animation-driven changes.

**3. `LevitationComponent`:**
This component defines properties related to levitation or floating.

```xml
  <Component component_name="LevitationComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="entity_force" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="box2d_force" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="effect_lifetime_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component would be used for entities that float, hover, or are affected by buoyancy, defining the area of effect, the force applied, and how long any associated visual effects last.
