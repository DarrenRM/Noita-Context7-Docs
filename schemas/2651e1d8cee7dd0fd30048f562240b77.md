# 2651e1d8cee7dd0fd30048f562240b77

This XML file defines the schema for various game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint for how different game entities and their behaviors are structured and configured. These schemas are crucial for the game's engine to understand and instantiate objects, enemies, spells, and other interactive elements, dictating their properties, actions, and interactions within the game world.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual variables or properties associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>` for transformations).

The structure is hierarchical, with the root element being `<Schema>` which contains all the `<Component>` definitions.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's data is organized around reusable components, allowing for modularity and flexibility in defining game entities.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's behavior and properties are defined by a set of named variables with specified data types and sizes.
*   **String Representation:** String data types are represented by `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, indicating they are standard C++ strings.
*   **Numerical Types:** Integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`) are used extensively for parameters like distances, durations, probabilities, and positions.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors.
*   **Complex Types:** Structures like `ceng::math::CXForm<float>` suggest the use of more complex data types for transformations and mathematical operations.

## Sample Entries

**1. AIAttackComponent:**
This component defines the parameters for an AI's attack behavior. It includes variables for attack probabilities, ranges, timing, and the specific projectile or effect to be used.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="frames_between" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="frames_between_global" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows how an AI's offensive capabilities are defined, from how often it attacks to what it attacks with.

**2. InheritTransformComponent:**
This component allows an entity to inherit the transformation (position, rotation, scale) of another entity, often its parent. It provides options to control which aspects of the transform are inherited and how.

```xml
  <Component component_name="InheritTransformComponent" >
    <Var name="use_root_parent" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="only_position" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="parent_hotspot_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="Transform" size="32" type="struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This is useful for attaching objects to characters or ensuring that parts of a larger entity move together.

**3. PixelSceneComponent:**
This component is used to define visual elements that are rendered as pixel art scenes. It specifies the file paths for the pixel scene data, visual assets, and background elements, along with their rendering properties.

```xml
  <Component component_name="PixelSceneComponent" >
    <Var name="pixel_scene" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="pixel_scene_visual" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="pixel_scene_background" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="background_z_index" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="offset_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="offset_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This component is likely used for defining environmental details, special effects, or unique visual elements within the game.
