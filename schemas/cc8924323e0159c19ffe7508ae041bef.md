# cc8924323e0159c19ffe7508ae041bef

This XML file defines the structure and types of data used for various game components in Noita. It acts as a schema, outlining the variables, their data types, and sizes for different game entities and systems. This file is crucial for understanding how game mechanics are implemented and for modding purposes, as it dictates the parameters that can be adjusted. The `hash` attribute in the root `<Schema>` tag likely serves as an identifier for this specific schema definition.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. Within each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements.

*   **`<Schema>`**: The root element, containing a `hash` attribute.
*   **`<Component>`**: Represents a specific game component (e.g., AI behavior, physics, animation). It has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the component.
*   **`<Var>`**: Defines a variable within a component. It has the following attributes:
    *   `name`: The name of the variable.
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `struct LensValue<float>` for specific structures).

The `<Var>` elements can be empty, indicating they are simply defining the variable's presence and type, or they can contain nested structures or further definitions, though the provided samples primarily show empty `<Var>` tags.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The game's functionality is broken down into modular components, each with its own set of configurable variables.
*   **Variable Naming Conventions**: Variable names are descriptive, often indicating their purpose (e.g., `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `velocity_min_x`).
*   **Data Type Variety**: The schema defines a range of data types, from primitive types like `int`, `float`, and `bool` to more complex C++ types like `std::basic_string` and custom `struct`s (e.g., `LensValue`, `CVector2`).
*   **Size Specification**: The `size` attribute provides information about the memory footprint of each variable, which is important for understanding data serialization and memory management.
*   **AI and Physics Focus**: Several components in the samples relate to AI behavior (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`) and physics/movement (`CharacterPlatformingComponent`, `PathFindingGridMarkerComponent`), suggesting these are core areas defined by this schema.

## Sample Entries

### AIAttackComponent

This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_aim_rotation_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables controlling attack range, timing, animations, and projectile spawning for AI entities.

### CharacterPlatformingComponent

This component details parameters for character movement and platforming.

```xml
  <Component component_name="CharacterPlatformingComponent" >
    <Var name="velocity_min_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="velocity_max_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="ground_attachment_max_tries" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="ground_attachment_max_angle" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This section defines minimum and maximum horizontal velocities, as well as parameters for how characters attach to the ground.

### PathFindingGridMarkerComponent

This component appears to be related to pathfinding and spatial awareness for entities.

```xml
  <Component component_name="PathFindingGridMarkerComponent" >
    <Var name="marker_work_flag" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="marker_offset_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="marker_offset_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables for marking positions or areas within a pathfinding grid, likely used for navigation or AI decision-making.
