# 3765a380ff0b5c393beda5fe8d57549c

This XML file defines a collection of game components and their associated variables, which are fundamental building blocks for entities within the game Noita. These components dictate the behavior, properties, and interactions of various game objects, such as enemies, items, and environmental elements. By defining these components and their parameters, the game engine can construct and manage the diverse entities that populate the world. This file acts as a schema, outlining the structure and potential data for these game elements.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a root `<Schema>` element, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game logic or property and is identified by a `component_name` attribute. Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. Each `<Var>` element defines a specific variable or parameter for that component, characterized by:

*   **`name`**: The identifier for the variable.
*   **`size`**: The memory size allocated for the variable (often in bytes).
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are typically empty, indicating that the schema defines the structure and type, but the actual values are set elsewhere in the game's data.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="3765a380ff0b5c393beda5fe8d57549c" >
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    </Component>
  <Component component_name="AIComponent" >
    </Component>
</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several key patterns emerge from the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design**: The game utilizes a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file defines the available components and their configurable parameters.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component is a collection of variables, each with a specific name, size, and data type. This allows for fine-grained control over entity behavior.
*   **Data Types**: Common data types include integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), booleans (`bool`), and strings (represented by `class std::basic_string<...>`).
*   **AI and Behavior**: Components like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` suggest a focus on defining artificial intelligence and entity behaviors, including attack parameters, movement speeds, and state durations.
*   **Item Properties**: Components like `ItemComponent` define characteristics of in-game items, such as whether they are stackable or consumable.
*   **Physics and Movement**: Components like `PhysicsThrowableComponent` and variables within `AIComponent` (e.g., `velocity_max_y`, `run_velocity`) indicate definitions related to physics, movement, and projectile behavior.
*   **String Representation**: String types are consistently represented by the verbose `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, which is a C++ standard library string.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
```
This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for the probability of using an attack, the effective range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), the angular spread of the attack (`angular_range_deg`), the name of the attack animation, and the entity file to spawn for ranged attacks.

**2. `AIComponent` Movement Variables:**

```xml
    <Var name="velocity_max_y" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="run_velocity" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="fly_velocity_x" size="12" type="struct LensValue<float>" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="accel_x" size="4" type="float" >
```
This snippet from the `AIComponent` details movement parameters. It shows variables for maximum vertical velocity (`velocity_max_y`), running speed (`run_velocity`), horizontal flight speed (`fly_velocity_x`), and horizontal acceleration (`accel_x`). The `struct LensValue<float>` type suggests a more complex float value, possibly with min/max or other modifiers.

**3. `ItemComponent` Properties:**

```xml
    <Var name="item_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_stackable" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_consumable" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
```
This excerpt from the `ItemComponent` defines fundamental properties of an item. It includes the item's name, a boolean flag indicating if it can be stacked in the inventory, and another boolean flag for whether it is a consumable item.
