# 2fa8f0ced5713de9cbe00d30e90ce0f3

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components and entities within Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint, detailing the data types, sizes, and names of variables that make up different game elements. These definitions are crucial for the game engine to correctly load, interpret, and utilize the data associated with entities, their behaviors, and their interactions. Essentially, this file dictates how different parts of the game world are constructed and how they function.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. These components are identified by their `component_name` attribute. Within each `<Component>`, individual properties are defined using `<Var>` tags.

Each `<Var>` tag has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable or property.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `struct ceng::math::CXForm<float>`, `class ConfigExplosion`).

The content within a `<Var>` tag is typically empty, as the definition is provided by the attributes.

**Example Structure:**

```xml
<Schema hash="2fa8f0ced5713de9cbe00d30e90ce0f3" >

  <Component component_name="ComponentName" >
    <Var name="variable_name_1" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_2" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="variable_name_3" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    </Component>

  <Component component_name="AnotherComponent" >
    </Component>

</Schema>
```

## Key Patterns

Several patterns emerge from the sampled content:

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game appears to use a component-based architecture, where entities are composed of various functional components. This file defines the properties for these components.
*   **AI and Behavior:** Components like `AIAttackComponent` and `AIComponent` suggest a robust system for defining enemy AI, including attack patterns, ranges, and behaviors.
*   **Inventory Management:** `InventoryComponent` and `Inventory2Component` indicate systems for managing player or entity inventories, including the number and layout of slots.
*   **Transform and Physics:** The presence of `Transform` with a `ceng::math::CXForm<float>` type points to a system for handling object positioning, rotation, and scaling, likely tied to the game's physics engine.
*   **Material Interaction:** `MaterialSuckerComponent` suggests mechanics related to absorbing or manipulating materials.
*   **String Representation:** The frequent use of `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for `type` indicates that string values are used extensively for names, identifiers, and configuration parameters.
*   **Numerical Data Types:** `int` and `float` are common for numerical values like sizes, distances, speeds, and damage. `double` is used for higher precision values like `noise_scale` and `noise_threshold`.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` is used for simple on/off states or flags.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This section defines parameters for an AI's attack capabilities. It includes probabilities, distance thresholds, animation names, and details about ranged attacks, such as the entity file to be spawned and its count.

2.  **`AIComponent` Attack Melee Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="attack_melee_damage_min" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_melee_damage_max" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_melee_impulse_vector_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_melee_offset_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This snippet from the `AIComponent` details melee attack properties. It specifies the minimum and maximum damage, the impulse vector for knockback, and positional offsets for the attack.

3.  **`MaterialSuckerComponent` Variables:**
    ```xml
    <Var name="material_type" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="barrel_size" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="num_cells_sucked_per_frame" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="set_projectile_to_liquid" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    ```
    This component defines the behavior of a "material sucker." It includes parameters for the type of material it affects, its size, how many units it processes per frame, and whether it converts projectiles to liquids.
