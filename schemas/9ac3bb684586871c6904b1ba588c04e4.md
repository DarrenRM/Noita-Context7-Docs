# 9ac3bb684586871c6904b1ba588c04e4

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used within Noita. These components are fundamental building blocks that dictate the behavior, appearance, and interactions of entities in the game world, such as enemies, items, and environmental elements. By defining these components in a structured format, the game engine can efficiently load and manage the vast array of game objects and their associated logic. This file acts as a schema, outlining the expected variables and their types for each component.

## File Structure

The file is structured as an XML document. The root element is `<Schema>`, which contains multiple `<Component>` elements. Each `<Component>` element represents a distinct type of game component and is identified by a `component_name` attribute.

Within each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements. Each `<Var>` element defines a specific variable or property associated with that component. These `<Var>` elements have the following key attributes:

*   **`name`**: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `radius`, `speed`).
*   **`size`**: The size of the variable in bytes. This often indicates the data type.
*   **`type`**: The data type of the variable. Common types include `int`, `float`, `bool`, and more complex C++ class types like `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` (which represents a string) or `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>` (representing a 2D vector).

The structure is hierarchical: `Schema` -> `Component` -> `Var`.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design**: The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated into distinct components. This allows for modularity and reusability of game logic.
*   **Variable Definitions**: Each component's behavior is defined by a set of variables, each with a specific name, size, and data type. This provides a clear and organized way to configure game entities.
*   **Data Types**: A variety of data types are used, ranging from primitive types like integers and booleans to more complex C++ types, indicating the sophistication of the game's internal systems.
*   **AI and Behavior**: Many components appear to be related to Artificial Intelligence and entity behavior, such as `AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`, `FishAIComponent`, and `FlyingComponent`. These components likely control how entities perceive their environment, make decisions, and act.
*   **Physical Properties**: Components like `CardinalMovementComponent` and `CellEaterComponent` suggest definitions for physical movement and interaction with the game world's materials.
*   **Visual and Scene Elements**: Components like `PixelSceneComponent` indicate how visual elements and scene properties are defined.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent` (from the first 100 lines):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component defines parameters for an AI's attack behavior. It includes variables for attack probability, range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), targeting angle (`angular_range_deg`), duration, associated animations (`animation_name`), and details about ranged attacks, such as the entity to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_file`) and the number of entities to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_count_min`, `attack_ranged_entity_count_max`).

**2. `CellEaterComponent` (from lines 912-962):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="CellEaterComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="eat_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="ignored_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="only_stain" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component seems to define entities that can consume or interact with the game's "cells" or materials. It has a `radius` for its effect, an `eat_probability`, a way to specify `ignored_material` types, and a boolean flag `only_stain` which might control whether it fully consumes or just marks materials.

**3. `FlyingComponent` (from lines 2037-2087):**

```xml
  <Component component_name="FlyingComponent" >
    <Var name="type" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="perlin_freq" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="perlin_time_freq" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="perlin_wind_x" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="perlin_wind_y" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```

This component likely governs entities that exhibit flying behavior. It includes a `type` for different flying modes, and parameters related to Perlin noise (`perlin_freq`, `perlin_time_freq`, `perlin_wind_x`, `perlin_wind_y`), suggesting that its flight path or movement might be procedurally generated or influenced by simulated wind.
