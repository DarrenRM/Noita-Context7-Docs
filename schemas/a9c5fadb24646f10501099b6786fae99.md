# a9c5fadb24646f10501099b6786fae99

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint, outlining the data fields and their types for different game entities and systems. This is crucial for the game engine to understand how to interpret and utilize the data associated with each component, influencing everything from enemy AI behavior to visual effects and item properties.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a series of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct functional part of the game. Within each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables.

*   **`<Schema>`:** The root element, containing a `hash` attribute.
*   **`<Component>`:** Represents a specific game component. It has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the component (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `DrugEffectComponent`).
*   **`<Var>`:** Defines a variable or property within a component.
    *   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `change_speed`).
    *   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
    *   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`, `enum BUILDINGUI_TYPE::Enum`, `class ConfigDrugFx`, `class ceng::math::CVector2<float>`).

The structure is hierarchical, with `<Var>` elements nested within their respective `<Component>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The file clearly follows a component-based architecture, where game logic and data are organized into modular components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's behavior is defined by a set of variables, each with a specific name, size, and data type.
*   **String Representation:** String types are consistently represented using `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Custom Class Types:** The schema includes custom class types, such as `ConfigDrugFx` and `ceng::math::CVector2<float>`, indicating more complex data structures are used for certain properties.
*   **Enums:** Enumerated types are used for properties with a fixed set of possible values, like `BUILDINGUI_TYPE::Enum`.
*   **Data Types:** Common C++ data types like `int`, `float`, and `bool` are prevalent, along with more complex class types.

## Sample Entries

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`:**
    This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      </Component>
    ```
    This sample shows how an AI's attack range, probability, and the specific entity file used for ranged attacks are defined.

2.  **`DrugEffectComponent`:**
    This component details the effects of various drugs on the player or entities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="DrugEffectComponent" >
      <Var name="change_speed" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="alcohol_amount" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="hallucinogen_amount" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="nightvision_amount" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="stoned_amount" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="drug_fx_target" size="28" type="class ConfigDrugFx" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    Here, variables like `alcohol_amount` and `nightvision_amount` control the intensity of drug effects, while `drug_fx_target` likely points to a configuration for visual or auditory effects.

3.  **`PotionComponent`:**
    This component defines properties related to potions.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PotionComponent" >
      <Var name="spray_velocity_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="body_colored" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="throw_how_many" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="never_color" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This shows how potion properties like spray velocity, whether the potion's body can be colored, and how many are thrown are configured.
