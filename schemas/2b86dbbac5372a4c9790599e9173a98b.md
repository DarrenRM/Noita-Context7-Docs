# 2b86dbbac5372a4c9790599e9173a98b

This XML file defines a schema for game components in Noita. It acts as a blueprint or template for how various game entities' behaviors and properties are structured. These schemas are fundamental to the game's data-driven design, allowing for the definition of everything from enemy AI to environmental effects. By using these schemas, Noita can efficiently load and manage the vast amount of data that makes up its world, its creatures, and its mechanics.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that uniquely identifies it. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements, which define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` for strings, `enum GAME_EFFECT::Enum` for enums, `class std::vector<...>` for arrays/lists).

The structure is hierarchical: the root `<Schema>` element contains multiple `<Component>` elements, and each `<Component>` contains multiple `<Var>` elements.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The entire file is organized around distinct game components, suggesting a modular approach to game design where entities are composed of various functional parts.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component's properties are defined using `<Var>` tags, specifying their names, sizes, and data types. This provides a clear and structured way to define game data.
*   **String Representation:** String data types are consistently represented as `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`. This indicates how string values are stored internally.
*   **Vector/Array Representation:** Collections of data, such as lists of strings or custom structures, are represented using `class std::vector<...>`. The specific types within the vector are detailed in the template arguments.
*   **Enum Types:** Specific enumerated types, like `GAME_EFFECT::Enum`, are used to represent predefined sets of values for certain variables.
*   **Boolean Representation:** Boolean values are represented with `size="1"` and `type="bool"`.
*   **Numerical Types:** Integers are represented as `int` and floating-point numbers as `float`.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component appears to define parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This sample shows variables like `use_probability`, `min_distance`, `max_distance`, and `angular_range_deg` which likely control how and when an AI attacks. It also includes parameters for ranged attacks, such as the `animation_name` and the `attack_ranged_entity_file` (likely the file path for the projectile or effect).

2.  **`FogOfWarRadiusComponent`**: This component defines a radius for fog of war effects.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="FogOfWarRadiusComponent" >
      <Var name="radius" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This is a simple component with a single variable, `radius`, which is a float. It's likely used to define areas that are obscured by fog of war or areas that reveal the map.

3.  **`PhysicsAIComponent`**: This component seems to govern the physics-based movement and behavior of AI entities.
    ```xml
    <Component component_name="PhysicsAIComponent" >
      <Var name="target_vec_max_len" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="force_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="force_max" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="torque_coeff" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
    This component includes variables like `force_coeff`, `force_max`, and `torque_coeff`, suggesting it controls the forces and torques applied to an entity to influence its movement and rotation, likely in conjunction with a physics engine.
