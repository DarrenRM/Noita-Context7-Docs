# 98fcf357faaafb6d2a4afd01ad059440

This XML file defines a schema for game data within Noita. It acts as a blueprint or template for how various game entities, components, and their properties are structured and represented. This schema file is crucial for the game's engine to understand and load the data associated with different game elements, such as enemies, items, spells, and environmental objects. By defining these structures, the game can consistently manage and utilize these elements throughout gameplay.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component or entity. The root element `<Schema>` encloses all these components and has a `hash` attribute, likely used for internal identification or versioning.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that clearly identifies the type of component it defines (e.g., `AIAttackComponent`, `AudioComponent`, `ItemAlchemyComponent`).

Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements. These `<Var>` elements define individual properties or variables associated with that component. Each `<Var>` has the following attributes:

*   `name`: The name of the variable (e.g., `use_probability`, `file`, `action_id`).
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The `<Var>` elements can be empty, indicating that their values are defined elsewhere or are implicitly handled by the game engine.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The schema strongly suggests a component-based design for game entities. Different functionalities (AI, audio, item actions, etc.) are encapsulated in distinct components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is described by a set of named variables with specified data types and sizes. This allows for granular control over the properties of game elements.
*   **String Representation:** The `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` type consistently appears for string-based properties, such as filenames or animation names.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` type variables are used extensively for enabling or disabling specific behaviors or properties (e.g., `attack_landing_ranged_enabled`, `play_only_if_visible`, `is_self_healing`).
*   **Numerical Properties:** `int` and `float` types are used for numerical values like probabilities, distances, durations, and offsets.
*   **Enums:** The presence of `enum` types (e.g., `MOVETOSURFACE_TYPE::Enum`) indicates that certain variables can only take a predefined set of values.

## Sample Entries

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**:
    This component defines parameters related to an AI's attack capabilities. It includes variables for attack probability (`use_probability`), range (`min_distance`, `max_distance`), aiming (`angular_range_deg`), timing (`state_duration_frames`, `frames_between`), and specific ranged attack properties like the entity to spawn (`attack_ranged_entity_file`) and its count (`attack_ranged_entity_count_min`, `attack_ranged_entity_count_max`).

    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
      <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="state_duration_frames" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="frames_between" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="frames_between_global" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_landing_ranged_enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_min" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_count_max" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
      </Component>
    ```

2.  **`AudioComponent`**:
    This component defines parameters for audio playback associated with an entity. It includes fields for the audio file (`file`), an event root name (`event_root`), and a physics material for sound effects (`audio_physics_material`). It also has boolean flags to control playback behavior like `set_latest_event_position` and `play_only_if_visible`.

    ```xml
    <Component component_name="AudioComponent" >
      <Var name="file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="event_root" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="audio_physics_material" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="set_latest_event_position" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
      <Var name="play_only_if_visible" size="1" type="bool" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```

3.  **`ItemAlchemyComponent`**:
    This component appears to be related to alchemy mechanics, specifically tracking the usage of an item in alchemical processes. The sample shows a variable `mAmountUsed` of type `int`, which likely tracks how many times an item has been consumed or used in an alchemical reaction.

    ```xml
    <Component component_name="ItemAlchemyComponent" >
      <Var name="mAmountUsed" size="4" type="int" >
      </Var>
    </Component>
    ```
