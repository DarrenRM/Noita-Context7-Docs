# 1b534be92fb0290742b586386df82f06

This XML file defines the schema for various game components and their associated variables within the game Noita. It acts as a blueprint or template for how different game entities and their behaviors are structured and configured. This file is crucial for understanding and potentially modifying the game's mechanics, as it outlines the properties that can be adjusted for elements like AI behavior, item properties, and environmental interactions.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct game component. The root element is `<Schema>` which contains a `hash` attribute.

Each `<Component>` element has a `component_name` attribute that identifies the specific component it defines. Inside each `<Component>`, there are multiple `<Var>` elements.

Each `<Var>` element represents a configurable variable for that component and has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The `<Var>` elements themselves are empty, indicating that their values are defined elsewhere, likely in other data files that reference these schemas.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Design:** The game's functionality is broken down into modular components, each with its own set of configurable variables.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each variable is precisely defined by its name, size, and data type, allowing for structured data management.
*   **String Representation:** String types are represented by a verbose C++-like type name, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are often used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors.
*   **Numerical Parameters:** `int` and `float` types are used for numerical values such as distances, durations, probabilities, and offsets.
*   **Categorization by Component:** The components appear to be grouped logically, for example, AI-related components (`AIAttackComponent`, `AIComponent`), item-related components (`ConsumableTeleportComponent`, `ItemChestComponent`), and material interaction components (`MaterialAreaComponent`).

## Sample Entries

1.  **`AIAttackComponent`**: This component appears to define the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.
    *   `use_probability`: Likely controls how often the AI uses this attack.
    *   `min_distance`, `max_distance`: Define the effective range of the attack.
    *   `angular_range_deg`: Specifies the cone of fire or targeting angle.
    *   `animation_name`: The name of the animation associated with the attack.
    *   `attack_ranged_entity_file`: The file path to the entity that is spawned when performing a ranged attack.

2.  **`ConsumableTeleportComponent`**: This component seems to govern the behavior of consumable items that enable teleportation.
    *   `create_other_end`: A boolean flag that might determine if a return portal is created.
    *   `is_at_home`: A boolean flag indicating if the teleport is to a "home" location.
    *   `collision_radius`: The radius for collision detection related to the teleport effect.

3.  **`MaterialAreaComponent`**: This component likely defines properties for areas that interact with or transform materials.
    *   `to_material`: An integer representing the material that the area converts to.
    *   `clean_stains`: A boolean flag to indicate if stains should be removed.
    *   `extinguish_fire`: A boolean flag to indicate if fire should be extinguished.
    *   `fan_the_flames`: An integer that might control the intensity or duration of fanning flames.
    *   `ignite_materials`: An integer that might control the ignition of materials.
