# 6a3ee422996ffdb6b583fd62ff884960

This XML file defines the structure and properties of various game components used in Noita. It acts as a schema or blueprint for how different game elements, such as entities, behaviors, and visual effects, are configured. By defining these components, the game can dynamically load and instantiate objects with specific characteristics, enabling the vast variety of enemies, items, and environmental interactions found in Noita. This file is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanics and for modding the game.

## File Structure

The file is structured as a collection of `<Component>` elements, each representing a distinct type of game component. Each `<Component>` has a `component_name` attribute that identifies its purpose. Inside each `<Component>`, there are `<Var>` elements that define individual properties or variables associated with that component.

Each `<Var>` element has the following attributes:
*   `name`: The name of the variable.
*   `size`: The size of the variable in bytes.
*   `type`: The data type of the variable (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`, `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >` which represents a string).

The content of a `<Var>` element is typically empty, as the actual values are defined elsewhere in the game's data files that reference these schemas.

## Key Patterns

*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The file clearly demonstrates a component-based design, where functionality is broken down into reusable components.
*   **Variable Definitions:** Each component is defined by a set of variables, specifying the data types and sizes for its configurable parameters.
*   **String Representation:** String types are represented by a verbose C++-like type: `class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >`. This often indicates file paths or descriptive names.
*   **Boolean Flags:** `bool` types are commonly used for enabling or disabling specific features or behaviors.
*   **Numerical Properties:** `int` and `float` types are used for numerical values such as distances, speeds, durations, and counts.

## Sample Entries

Here are a few representative examples from the sampled content:

**1. `AIAttackComponent`:**
This component appears to define the parameters for an AI's attack capabilities.
```xml
  <Component component_name="AIAttackComponent" >
    <Var name="use_probability" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="min_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="angular_range_deg" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="animation_name" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="attack_ranged_entity_file" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This sample shows variables related to attack range, timing, and the specific entity file used for ranged attacks.

**2. `CameraBoundComponent`:**
This component seems to control how entities interact with the camera's boundaries.
```xml
  <Component component_name="CameraBoundComponent" >
    <Var name="enabled" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="distance" size="4" type="float" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="max_count" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="freeze_on_distance_kill" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
Variables here suggest whether the component is active, its distance parameters, and conditions for freezing or killing entities based on camera proximity or count.

**3. `MagicConvertMaterialComponent`:**
This component defines a magical effect that converts one material into another.
```xml
  <Component component_name="MagicConvertMaterialComponent" >
    <Var name="radius" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="is_circle" size="1" type="bool" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="from_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="from_material_tag" size="24" type="class std::basic_string<char,struct std::char_traits<char>,class std::allocator<char> >" >
    </Var>
    <Var name="to_material" size="4" type="int" >
    </Var>
  </Component>
```
This shows parameters for the conversion radius, shape, the source material (by ID or tag), and the target material.
