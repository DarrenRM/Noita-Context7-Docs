# SineWaveComponent Documentation

This documentation covers the `SineWaveComponent` in Noita, a crucial element for creating dynamic and oscillating effects in your mods. Understanding this component allows you to implement features like pulsating lights, moving platforms, or any effect that requires periodic variation. This guide provides the necessary information to effectively utilize `SineWaveComponent` for AI-assisted mod development.

## Understanding SineWaveComponent

The `SineWaveComponent` is a fundamental building block for creating cyclical, wave-like behaviors within Noita. It's primarily used in entity XML definitions to control various properties over time, such as position, rotation, scale, or even custom variables. By defining parameters like amplitude, frequency, and phase, you can precisely control the nature of the oscillation.

### Core Parameters

The `SineWaveComponent` takes several parameters to define its behavior. These are typically set within the entity's XML definition.
