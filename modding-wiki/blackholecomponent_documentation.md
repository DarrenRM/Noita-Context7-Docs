# BlackHoleComponent Documentation

This documentation covers the `BlackHoleComponent` in Noita, a crucial component for creating entities that exhibit black hole-like behavior. Understanding this component is essential for modders looking to implement custom gravity effects, projectile manipulation, or unique enemy mechanics.

## Overview

The `BlackHoleComponent` is responsible for defining and controlling the gravitational pull of an entity. It dictates how other entities are attracted towards it, the strength of this attraction, and various other parameters that fine-tune the black hole's behavior. This allows for the creation of diverse and dynamic gameplay elements.

## Component Properties

The `BlackHoleComponent` has several properties that can be configured within an entity's XML definition. These properties allow for granular control over the black hole's effects.
