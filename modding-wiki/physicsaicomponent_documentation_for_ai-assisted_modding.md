Understanding this component is essential for modders looking to create custom enemies, allies, or environmental objects with unique movement and interaction patterns.

## Overview of PhysicsAIComponent

The `PhysicsAIComponent` dictates how an entity's AI interacts with the game's physics system. It allows for the creation of entities that can move, react to forces, and exhibit behaviors that are influenced by their physical presence in the world. This is fundamental for creating dynamic and believable AI in your mods.

## Component Properties

The `PhysicsAIComponent` has several properties that can be configured in your mod's XML files. These properties control various aspects of the AI's physical behavior.

### Movement and Steering
