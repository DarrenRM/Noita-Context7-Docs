# PhysicsRagdollComponent

This documentation explains the `PhysicsRagdollComponent` in Noita, a crucial component for defining how entities behave when they are affected by physics, particularly in a ragdoll-like manner. Understanding this component is essential for modders who wish to customize entity physics, create new types of enemies, or alter how existing entities react to impacts and forces.

## Overview

The `PhysicsRagdollComponent` is responsible for managing an entity's physical properties when it enters a ragdoll state. This includes defining its mass, friction, and how it interacts with the environment and other entities. It's fundamental for creating dynamic and believable physical interactions within the game.

## Component Properties

The `PhysicsRagdollComponent` has several properties that can be configured in an entity's XML definition. These properties allow for fine-grained control over the ragdoll's behavior.
