# GenomeDataComponent

This documentation covers the `GenomeDataComponent` in Noita, a crucial component for defining the genetic makeup and behavior of entities. Understanding this component is essential for modders looking to create custom enemies, allies, or modify existing ones by altering their inherent properties and interactions.

## Overview

The `GenomeDataComponent` is a fundamental part of Noita's entity system, dictating various aspects of an entity's "genome." This includes its appearance, its AI behavior, its combat capabilities, and how it interacts with the game world. Modding this component allows for deep customization of entity characteristics, enabling the creation of unique gameplay experiences.

## Component Structure and Properties

The `GenomeDataComponent` is defined within an entity's XML definition. It contains several key properties that influence the entity's behavior.
