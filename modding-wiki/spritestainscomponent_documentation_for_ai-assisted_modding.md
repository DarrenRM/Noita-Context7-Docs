# SpriteStainsComponent Documentation for AI-Assisted Modding

This documentation covers the `SpriteStainsComponent` in Noita, a crucial component for adding visual effects like blood splatters, acid drips, and other environmental decals to your game. Understanding and utilizing this component is essential for modders aiming to enhance the visual fidelity and immersion of their custom content.

## Understanding SpriteStainsComponent

The `SpriteStainsComponent` is responsible for rendering persistent visual effects on surfaces within the game world. These effects are typically sprite-based and can be triggered by various game events, such as character damage, spell impacts, or environmental interactions.

### Key Concepts

*   **Decals:** Sprite-based images that are "stamped" onto surfaces.
*   **Persistence:** Stains remain visible until they naturally fade or are removed.
*   **Surface Interaction:** Stains are applied to specific surfaces, respecting the game's collision and material properties.

## Component Properties

The `SpriteStainsComponent` is configured within an entity's XML definition. Here are the key properties you can modify:
