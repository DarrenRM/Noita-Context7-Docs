# UIInfoComponent Documentation

This document details the `UIInfoComponent` in Noita, a crucial component for displaying information within the game's user interface. Understanding and utilizing `UIInfoComponent` is essential for modders looking to create custom UI elements, display mod-specific data, or alter existing in-game information displays.

## Understanding UIInfoComponent

The `UIInfoComponent` is a fundamental building block for creating and managing UI elements that present information to the player. It's often used in conjunction with other UI components and scripting to dynamically update and display various types of data.

## Core Functionality and Usage

While the original wiki page had no specific text content for this section, the presence of a dedicated page for `UIInfoComponent` implies its importance in the Noita modding landscape. Modders would typically interact with this component through Lua scripting to:

*   **Create new UI elements:** Define what information is displayed and how.
*   **Modify existing UI elements:** Change the text, appearance, or data source of in-game information displays.
*   **Display mod-specific data:** Show custom statistics, item information, or status effects relevant to a mod.

## Related Components and Concepts

Modding the UI in Noita often involves understanding how different components work together. While not explicitly detailed on the original page, common related areas include:

*   **Entity System:** How UI elements are attached to or interact with game entities.
*   **Lua Scripting:** The primary language for controlling UI behavior and data.
*   **XML Definitions:** Used for defining the structure and initial properties of UI elements.
