# ConfigDamageCritical - Noita Modding Documentation

This documentation explains the `ConfigDamageCritical` component in Noita, which governs how critical damage is applied to entities. Understanding this component is crucial for modders who wish to alter combat mechanics, create unique damage interactions, or balance weapon and spell effects.

## Understanding Critical Damage

The `ConfigDamageCritical` component allows for the definition of critical hit multipliers and conditions. This is a fundamental aspect of Noita's combat system, influencing the effectiveness of attacks.

### Component Fields

The `ConfigDamageCritical` component has the following fields:

*   **`damage_multiplier`**: A float value that determines how much the base damage is multiplied when a critical hit occurs. A value of `2.0` means critical hits deal double damage.
*   **`critical_chance_flat`**: A float value representing a flat chance to trigger a critical hit, independent of other factors.
*   **`critical_chance_from_entity_component`**: The name of an entity component. If the entity has this component, its value will be added to the critical hit chance.
*   **`critical_chance_from_entity_tags`**: A list of entity tags. If the entity has any of these tags, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied. The exact bonus per tag might be defined elsewhere or be a default value.
*   **`critical_chance_from_material_tags`**: A list of material tags. If the material of the hit entity has any of these tags, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
*   **`critical_chance_from_projectile_tags`**: A list of projectile tags. If the projectile causing the hit has any of these tags, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
*   **`critical_chance_from_damage_type`**: A list of damage types. If the damage dealt matches one of these types, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
*   **`critical_chance_from_projectile_damage_type`**: A list of damage types. If the projectile's damage type matches one of these, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
*   **`critical_chance_from_hit_entity_damage_type`**: A list of damage types. If the hit entity's damage type matches one of these, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
*   **`critical_chance_from_hit_entity_material_damage_type`**: A list of damage types. If the hit entity's material's damage type matches one of these, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
*   **`critical_chance_from_hit_entity_biome`**: A list of biome names. If the hit entity is in one of these biomes, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
*   **`critical_chance_from_hit_entity_biome_tags`**: A list of biome tags. If the hit entity is in a biome with any of these tags, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
*   **`critical_chance_from_hit_entity_biome_material_tags`**: A list of biome material tags. If the hit entity is in a biome with materials having any of these tags, a bonus to critical hit chance is applied.
