# PixelSceneComponent Documentation

This document details the `PixelSceneComponent` in Noita, a crucial component for defining and manipulating the visual and physical properties of pixels within the game world. Understanding this component is essential for modders looking to create custom biomes, environmental effects, and unique material interactions.

## Overview of PixelSceneComponent

The `PixelSceneComponent` is a fundamental building block for defining how different materials behave in Noita. It dictates a pixel's visual appearance, its physical properties like density and friction, and its interactions with other game elements. Modding this component allows for the creation of entirely new material types with unique visual and physical characteristics.

## Component Properties

The `PixelSceneComponent` is defined within XML files and contains various properties that control its behavior.

### Core Properties

These are the primary properties that define a pixel's fundamental characteristics.
