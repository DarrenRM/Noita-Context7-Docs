# CharacterPlatformingComponent

This documentation details the `CharacterPlatformingComponent` in Noita, a crucial component for understanding and modifying character movement, jumping, and interaction with the environment. Modders can leverage this information to fine-tune player physics, implement custom movement mechanics, or alter how characters behave on different surfaces.

## Overview

The `CharacterPlatformingComponent` is responsible for managing a character's ability to interact with platforms, including jumping, falling, and sticking to surfaces. It defines parameters that control movement speed, jump height, gravity, and other physics-related aspects of character control. Understanding these properties is essential for any mod that aims to alter or enhance player movement.

## Component Properties

The `CharacterPlatformingComponent` has several properties that can be modified to change character behavior. These properties are typically found within the `data/components/` directory in the game files, often within XML files.
