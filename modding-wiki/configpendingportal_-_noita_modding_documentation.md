# ConfigPendingPortal - Noita Modding Documentation

This documentation page, though currently empty on the wiki, is intended to cover the `ConfigPendingPortal` entity in Noita. Understanding and potentially modifying this entity is crucial for modders looking to alter or create new portal behaviors, affecting player progression, level design, and game flow.

## Understanding ConfigPendingPortal

The `ConfigPendingPortal` entity is a fundamental component within Noita's game engine that dictates the behavior and destination of portals. While the wiki page itself has no content, its existence implies a system for configuring portals, likely through XML or Lua scripting, allowing modders to define where portals lead, what conditions might trigger them, and how they interact with the game world.

### Potential Modding Applications

Modders could leverage `ConfigPendingPortal` to:

*   **Create custom progression paths:** Redirect players to new areas or challenge rooms.
*   **Implement unique level mechanics:** Design puzzles or events that rely on specific portal activations.
*   **Alter existing portal functionality:** Change the destinations of standard portals for a different gameplay experience.
*   **Introduce dynamic events:** Make portals appear or disappear based on in-game conditions.

### Accessing and Modifying Portal Configurations

The exact methods for interacting with `ConfigPendingPortal` would typically involve:

*   **XML Entity Definitions:** Modifying or adding new entities that utilize `ConfigPendingPortal` components.
*   **Lua Scripting:** Using the Noita Lua API to dynamically create, modify, or query portal configurations.

Further details on specific XML tags, Lua functions, and component properties would be found on a fully populated page.

## Related Concepts and Resources

While this specific page lacks content, modding portals in Noita often involves understanding other related systems:

*   **Entities:** The fundamental building blocks of Noita's world.
*   **Components:** Attachments to entities that define their behavior and properties.
*   **Lua API:** The scripting interface for advanced modding.
*   **XML:** Used for defining entities and their components.
