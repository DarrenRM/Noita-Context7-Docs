# SimplePhysicsComponent

This documentation page details the `SimplePhysicsComponent` in Noita, a fundamental component for defining how entities interact with the game's physics system. Understanding this component is crucial for modders looking to create custom entities with unique physical behaviors, such as controlling their movement, collision, and environmental interactions.

## Overview

The `SimplePhysicsComponent` is a core part of Noita's entity system, responsible for managing an entity's physical properties. It dictates how an entity behaves in response to forces, collisions, and other environmental factors. By modifying or creating entities with this component, modders can achieve a wide range of effects, from making objects float to creating entities that are immune to certain types of damage.

## Component Properties

The `SimplePhysicsComponent` has several properties that can be configured within an entity's XML definition. These properties allow for fine-grained control over the entity's physical interactions.
