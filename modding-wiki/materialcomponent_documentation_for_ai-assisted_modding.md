# MaterialComponent Documentation for AI-Assisted Modding

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the `MaterialComponent` in Noita, a fundamental element for defining the physical and behavioral properties of materials within the game. Understanding `MaterialComponent` is crucial for modders looking to create new materials, alter existing ones, or implement complex interactions between game entities and the environment.

## Understanding MaterialComponent

The `MaterialComponent` is an entity component that defines the properties of a material. These properties dictate how a material behaves in the game world, including its physical characteristics, how it interacts with other entities, and its visual representation. Modding these components allows for significant customization of the game's physics and environmental effects.

### Core Properties

The `MaterialComponent` has several key properties that can be modified. These properties are typically defined in `.xml` files within the game's data.

#### Physical Properties

These properties govern the material's basic physical behavior.
