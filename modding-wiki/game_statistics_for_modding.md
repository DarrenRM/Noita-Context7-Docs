# Game Statistics for Modding

This documentation outlines the various game statistics and their corresponding numerical IDs used within Noita. Understanding these stats is crucial for modders to accurately modify game behavior, entity properties, and effects through scripting and configuration files.

## Understanding Game Statistics

Game statistics in Noita are numerical identifiers that represent specific attributes or properties of entities, spells, biomes, and other game elements. These IDs are used internally by the game engine to reference and manipulate these values. Modders will frequently interact with these IDs when creating custom spells, modifying enemy behavior, or altering world generation.
