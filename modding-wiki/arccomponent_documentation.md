# ArcComponent Documentation

This document details the `ArcComponent` in Noita, a crucial element for creating projectile-based spells and effects. Understanding `ArcComponent` is essential for modders looking to implement custom projectile behaviors, such as ricocheting, homing, or area-of-effect impacts.

## Overview of ArcComponent

The `ArcComponent` is a fundamental component used in Noita's entity system to define how projectiles behave after their initial launch. It governs aspects like their trajectory, interaction with the environment, and eventual destruction or effect application.

## ArcComponent Properties

The `ArcComponent` has several properties that can be configured to alter projectile behavior. These properties are typically defined within an entity's XML definition.
